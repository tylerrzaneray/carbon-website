A common flow might begin with the header, followed by\nthe main navigation, then content navigation (from left to right, top to\nbottom), and end with the footer. Try to give all your users the same\nexperience.\n\nUse natively-accessible elements in navigation to activate links, buttons, and\nform controls with a keyboard. Reinforce\n[semantic HTML](./developers#use-semantic-html) to convey intent and meaning\ninstead of solely defining the look and feel of an element.
