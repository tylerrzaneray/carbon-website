Whether spoken\nor written, one of the most important characteristics of IBM is our unique brand\nvoice. Our verbal identity must remain as recognizable to everyone as our visual\nidentity.\n\nUnderstanding IBM's personality and voice will help you reach for the best words\nas you develop content.\n\nIBM Brand Center offers the following guidelines on voice.\n\n#### When IBM content is at its best:\n\n- It has a clear point of view.\n- It’s simple and logical.\n- It builds on solid research, data, and analysis.\n- It’s intellectually ambitious, expressing a bigger idea.\n- It’s persuasive, not poetic.\n- It’s confident, but not boastful.\n- It only ever uses figurative language for emphasis.\n- It elevates facts and outcomes.\n- It engages the thinker by speaking like the thinker.\n\nFor additional guidance, please read the IBM Brand Center\n[voice guidelines](https://www.ibm.com/brand/expression#voice).\n\n### Tone\n\nTone describes how the IBM voice is expressed, and as such it can adapt to\ndifferent situations. For example, the words chosen for error messages differ\ngreatly from words you might see in an onboarding flow. The tone of error\nmessages is economical and direct, and they are often written in short phrases\ninstead of sentences. Onboarding flows typically take a little more time, with\nfull sentences and friendly explanations.\n\nThe underlying voice in each case is consistent but with different word choices\nand a different sentence structure, the style and tone adapts.\n\n## Writing for accessibility\n\nFor detailed guidance about writing for all users, please read the\n[Content design section](https://www.ibm.com/able/toolkit/design/content/text-equivalents)\nof the IBM Accessibility site.\n\nIt provides detailed guidance on the following topics:\n\n- text alternatives for visuals or audio content\n- errors and other messages\n- labels and inputs for forms\n- guidance for providing adequate context\n\nFurther guidance can be found in the\n[Web Content Accessibility](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/)\n[guidelines](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/).\n\n## Questions and feedback\n\nIf there's something you need and cannot find, or if you need clarification\nabout a particular use case, you can ask questions in the\n[Carbon Slack channel](#carbon-design-system), open a Github issue, or connect\nwith us in one of our\n[meetups](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/whats-happening/meetups).\n\n## References\n\nExternal audiences can see the IBM Style guidance in\n[The IBM Style Guide: Conventions for Writers and Editors](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/the-ibm-style/9780132118989/)\n(IBM Press, 2011).\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"63d99562ed4a612f0d649ee12f31b82f","owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx","counter":4100},"frontmatter":{"title":"Content","description":"Well-designed content empowers people to use our offerings with ease.
