Primarily, productive was designed for product and expressive was\ndesigned for web pages, but there are opportunities to blend contrasting moments\nto provide clarity through hierarchy, and elevate the overall experience.\n\n</PageDescription>\n\n<AnchorLinks>\n\n<AnchorLink>Overview</AnchorLink>\n<AnchorLink>Productive use cases</AnchorLink>\n<AnchorLink>Expressive use cases</AnchorLink>\n<AnchorLink>Blending type sets</AnchorLink>\n<AnchorLink>Guidelines</AnchorLink>\n<AnchorLink>Getting help</AnchorLink>\n\n</AnchorLinks>\n\n## Overview\n\nWithin Carbon, there are two type sets available for use with productive and\nexpressive moments. The productive type styles were developed for product\ndesign, and the expressive, more editorial type styles were developed for\nIBM.com website pages.\n\nThe overarching rule has been to use the productive type styles for product\ndesign and the expressive for editorial pages. For the most part, this is still\na good guideline to follow. However, there are situations where we can create\ncontrasting moments that better support the user's intention or task.\n\nLet's look at the respective design rationales for each experience, and then see\nwhere it makes sense to provide a blend.\n\n## Productive use cases\n\nCarbon Design System started as the design system for Cloud console and provides\ntypography that supports productive use cases.\n\n#### When to use productive type styles\n\nThe key drivers for the use of productive type styles are:\n\n- Users are focused on getting a specific job done.\n- Interactions are more active, through inputs, forms, and controls.\n- Users are embedded within the experience, often on one page, for awhile.\n- Key performance indicators consider success in terms of time needed to\n  complete a task and also the abandonment rate.\n\nGiven these considerations, space efficiency is key. Keeping content condensed\nis helpful to support focus on complex tasks.\n\n#### Styles for productive moments\n\nTo create productive moments, use the body styles and supporting styles with the\n`01` suffix, as well as the fixed headings.\n\nTo ensure consistent line heights, use the following pairings:\n\n- pair `body-compact-01` with the `heading-compact-01`\n- pair `body-01` with the `heading-01`\n\nProductive headings are fixed.\n\n## Expressive use cases\n\nCarbon for IBM.com is for the creators of IBM.com and it provides typography\nthat supports expressive use cases.\n\n#### When to use expressive type styles\n\nThe key drivers for the use of expressive type styles are:\n\n- Users are trying to learn and explore, and are primarily scanning and reading.\n- Interactions are more passive through impactful imagery, layout, and long form\n  reading.\n- Users typically traverse a series of pages during one session.\n- Key performance indicators consider success in terms of click-through rates\n  and final purchases.\n\nGiven these considerations, larger type sizes and a more editorial approach\nallows users to scan, read, and navigate multiple pages with comfort and ease.\n\n#### Styles for expressive moments\n\nTo create expressive moments, use the body styles and supporting styles with the\n`02` suffix. There are also two fixed headings, as well as fluid headings that\nwill adjust with different breakpoints.\n\nFor the fixed headings, ensure consistent line heights by using the following\npairings:\n\n- pair `body-compact-02` with the `heading-compact-02`\n- pair `body-02` with the `heading-02`\n\nAs well as these two fixed headings, there is a set of fluid headings that add a\nseries of scales and fluid behavior.\n\n## Blending type sets\n\nThe spaces we are designing for are no longer neatly divided between productive\nand expressive. Both product and web pages can be blended with what we call\n\"moments\" if the alternative type set better supports the function.\n\nUsers working in product pages benefit from an expressive moment for easy\nreading or a pause. In these cases, however the \"moment\" would span a full page\nor banner where there are no containers.\n\nIf your users are working in a product but pausing to read or scan for options,\nan expressive moment can facilitate easy reading and/or create a desired impact\nor pause. In these cases, however the \"moment\" would span a full page or banner\nwhere there are no containers.\n\nIf your users are on the website and reading, but then switch to a focused task\nwithin the web experience, using productive styles within that component would\nfacilitate focus.\n\n### Using productive moments within IBM.com pages\n\nHere are some of the places the Dotcom team use productive moments:\n\n- The global masthead mega menu\n- IBM.com search\n- Commerce\n- Product configuration\n- Account creation\n- Filter panel in catalogs\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={12}>\n\n![Example of productive type styles in website mega menu](images/productive-in-expressive-megamenu.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n<Caption>\n  The mega menu with the more compact productive type styles allows users to see\n  the full range of offerings.\n</Caption>\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={12}>\n\n![Example of productive tabs on a web page](images/productive-in-expressive-tabs2.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n<Caption>Using productive type styles on tabs provides a distinction in scale. It creates a hierarchy that keeps focus on the results.</Caption>\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={12}>\n\n![Example of productive moment with account creation form](images/productive-in-expressive-URX.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n<Caption>\n  Account creation form with expressive type on the left, and productive type\n  for the form interactions on the right. It shows how both type styles can work\n  side by side.\n</Caption>\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={12}>\n\n![Example of filter panel component on website](images/productive-in-expressive-filter.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n<Caption>\n  Juxtaposing productive type within an expressive page is a useful tactic for\n  creating a setback or a hierarchy.\n</Caption>\n\n### Using expressive moments within product designs\n\nThe productive experience is all about keeping the user focused and able to\ncomplete complex tasks, therefore the areas where expressive moments can be used\nare less common. However, when the user is first entering the product, or moving\nto another area of the product you may find opportunities.\n\nFor expressive moments, you are looking for areas where the page opens up and\nthe content is not restricted to a container, card, or data table. Home pages\nand page headers or banners are two possibilites.\n\nFor more details about home pages, IBMers can reference the\n[World overview page pattern](https://pages.github.ibm.com/ibmcloud/pal/patterns/world-overview-pages/usage/)\nin the IBM Cloud library.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={12}>\n\n![Example of expressive moment on product home page](images/expressive-in-productive-homepage.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n<Caption>\n  A product home page provides an opportunity to create both visual interest,\n  distinction, and hierarchy with a blend of expressive and productive type\n  styles.\n</Caption>\n\n## Tips and techniques\n\n#### Use a blend of the two sets to establish distinctions and create hierarchies\n\nYou can use the two type sets to provide contrast and hierarchy within two\nareas. For example, the filter panel using productive type becomes less\nprominent next to a list of results using expressive type styles. You can push\nthe functional elements into the background, while keeping the items of user\ninterest in the foreground.\n\n#### Match and support user tasks\n\nWithin each type set, there are appropriately sized type styles for each user\ntask. Follow the use case definitions for expressive and productive moments to\ndetermine when it's appropriate to use each type set.\n\n_When users need to focus on a task_ and are interacting through inputs, forms,\nand controls, use the productive type set.\n\n_When users are learning and exploring,_ and interacting through impactful\nimagery, layout, and long form reading, pull from the expressive type set.\n\n#### Keep type styles consistent within a discrete task, component, or region\n\nPeople unconsciously use type size as a signal of hierarchy, and each type set\nhas been designed with expectations about hierarchy in mind. Mixing type styles\nwithin a component could jumble the hierarchy and create confusion.\n\n## Questions?\n\n_For IBMers only:_ If you have any questions about using either of these\nexperiences, reach out to the teams on Slack or sign up to share your work in a\nreview.\n\n#### Carbon Design System\n\n- Slack channel:\n  [#carbon-design-system](https://ibm-studios.slack.com/messages/C0M053VPT/)\n- [Meetups](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/whats-happening/meetups/) with\n  Carbon Design System\n\n#### Carbon for IBM Dotcom\n\n- Slack channel:\n  [#carbon-for-ibm-dotcom](https://cognitive-app.slack.com/archives/C2PLX8GQ6)\n- Office hours with Carbon for IBM.com.
