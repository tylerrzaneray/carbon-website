There are two Markdown templates to choose from:\n\n- **Pattern with a single variant**: Use this template if your pattern has one\n  primary solution. This is the most common.\n- **Pattern with multiple variants**: Use this template if your content covers\n  multiple variants of the pattern.\n\nYou may need to adjust the topic order to best tell the story but your pattern\nshould cover all of the topics outlined in each of these templates.\n\nIf you would like some assistance with the best approach for your pattern,\nplease [reach out](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/help/contact-us). We'd be\nhappy to work through the options with you.\n\n```markdown\n---\ntitle: Pattern name\ndescription: Explain the pattern in one or two sentences.\n---\n\n<PageDescription>\n\nExplain the pattern in one or two sentences.\n\n</PageDescription>\n\n<AnchorLinks>\n\n<AnchorLink>Overview</AnchorLink>  \n<AnchorLink>Designing with [pattern]</AnchorLink>  \n<AnchorLink>Accessibility</AnchorLink>  \n<AnchorLink>Related</AnchorLink>  \n<AnchorLink>References</AnchorLink>  \n<AnchorLink>Feedback</AnchorLink>\n\n</AnchorLinks>\n\n## Overview\n\nThis section answers the question: “What problem does this pattern solve?”\n\n- Define the use of your pattern and what it does.\n- Explain a user’s needs and how the pattern meets those needs.\n\n### Anatomy\n\nInclude an image with callouts explaining each part of the pattern. See the\n[Forms pattern](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/patterns/forms-pattern#anatomy-of-a-form)\nfor an example.\n\n### When to use\n\nInclude a short list describing situations where this pattern could be applied.\n\nFor example, use this pattern when:\n\n- Situation 1\n- Situation 2\n\n### When not to use (optional)\n\nIf required, include a short explanation about when not to use this pattern.\n\n## Designing with [pattern]\n\nThis section explains the pattern in detail. Use a combination of written\nexplanations and visuals to tell the story.\n\nDescribe the elements, components, and content that make up the pattern.\n\nShow the pattern in context. Use visuals throughout your written commentary to\nillustrate your guidance.\n\nDifferent patterns require different visuals to best explain the behaviors and\nhierarchy. Choose the options that make the most sense for the story you are\ntelling.\n\n- Use annotated wireframes or sketches to explain the visual hierarchy of\n  components.\n- Create high-level user flows to explain the big picture.\n- Create a functional prototype if that is the best way to illustrate the\n  pattern's behavior.\n\nProvide a Sketch file with any symbols you've created in the development of this\npattern.\n\nUse the following headings as guidelines for the kind of information to include.\nDepending on the requirements of your pattern, you may choose to present these\nheadings as H2 headings or as H3 headings underneath a more general \"Designing\nwith [pattern]\" heading. See the\n[Dialogs pattern](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/patterns/dialog-pattern/#designing-with-dialogs)\nas an example.\n\n### Types of [pattern]\n\nIf the pattern has different types or visual treatments that serve different use\ncases, cover them here and be sure to explain when to use each type.\n\nSee the\n[Empty states](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/patterns/empty-states-pattern#when-to-use)\npattern and the\n[Notification](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/patterns/notification-pattern#notification-types)\npattern for examples.\n\n### Behaviors\n\nDescribe behaviors, including guidance on interactions, and changes in states\nand content.\n\n### Best practices\n\nAre there any do's and don'ts specific to this variant? Include them here.\n\nFor examples of how to lay out this kind of information, see\n[Dropdown](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/dropdown/usage) and\n[Modal](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/modal/usage#variations).\n\n### Visual guidance\n\nCover any important topics such as alignment, image choice considerations, or\nspecial treatments in situations with no data or multiple instances of elements.\nSee the\n[Empty states pattern](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/patterns/empty-states-pattern#visual-guidelines-for-smaller-empty-spaces)\nand the\n[Forms pattern](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/patterns/forms-pattern#designing-a-form)\nfor examples.\n\n### Other use cases\n\nIf there are use cases that require a different solution, include those here\nwith corresponding explanations and visuals. Be sure to explain the reasons for\nusing one solution over another.\n\n## Accessibility\n\nEvaluate your pattern to ensure it meets\n[accessibility standards](notion://www.notion.so/guidelines/accessibility/overview)\nand guidelines, and provide details of compliance.\n\nFor example, “Users should be able to TAB into the input field of the search box\nto begin typing and press ENTER to run the search query.”\n\nFor examples, see the\n[Text toolbar pattern](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/patterns/text-toolbar-pattern#accessibility)\nand the\n[Search pattern](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/patterns/search-pattern#accessibility).\n\n## Related\n\nWhich components are used when building this pattern? Did you reference other\npatterns? List them here.\n\nIf necessary, clarify any differences between this pattern and related patterns.\n\n## References\n\nHelp designers understand your process by explaining your rationale for the way\nyou implemented the pattern. Include any research, citations, books or articles\nthat you found helpful.\n\n## Feedback\n\nHelp us improve this pattern by providing feedback, asking questions, and\nleaving any other comments on\n[GitHub](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-website/issues/new?assignees=&labels=feedback&template=feedback.md).\n```\n\n<Caption>Template for patterns with one primary solution</Caption>\n\n```markdown\n---\ntitle: Pattern name (multiple variants)\ndescription: Explain the pattern in one or two sentences.\n---\n\n<PageDescription>\n\nExplain the pattern in one or two sentences.\n\n</PageDescription>\n\n<AnchorLinks>\n\n<AnchorLink>Overview</AnchorLink>  \n<AnchorLink>Designing with [pattern]</AnchorLink>  \n<AnchorLink>[Pattern] variant</AnchorLink>  \n<AnchorLink>Accessibility</AnchorLink>  \n<AnchorLink>Related</AnchorLink>  \n<AnchorLink>References</AnchorLink>  \n<AnchorLink>Feedback</AnchorLink>\n\n</AnchorLinks>\n\n## Overview\n\nInclude a paragraph or two that describes the primary use cases for the pattern\nand details about how it helps the user achieve any tasks.\n\nThe purpose of this overview section is to set context for your readers.\n\n### Anatomy\n\nIt can be helpful to show images of all of the variants in small form together.\nSee the\n[Dialogs pattern](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/patterns/dialog-pattern#modal-variants)\nand the\n[Notifications pattern](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/patterns/notification-pattern#notification-types)\nfor examples of this visual treatment.\n\nAlternatively, if there is one variant that includes common aspects of the\npattern that are seen across all or most variants, include an image with\ncallouts explaining each part of the pattern.
