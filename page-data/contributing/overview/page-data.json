Contributors like you help to\nmake Carbon great, and so we're glad you're here.\n\nContributions are not limited to code. We also encourage feedback,\ndocumentation, new designs, and tools.\n\nAll you need is a [public GitHub account](https://github.com/join) to get\nstarted. Most contributions begin with a GitHub issue using one of these\ntemplates:\n\n- [Ask a question](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/new?assignees=&labels=type%3A+question+%3Aquestion%3A&template=question.md&title=)\n- [Report a bug](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/new?assignees=&labels=type%3A+bug+%F0%9F%90%9B&template=bug-report.md&title=)\n- [Request a feature](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/issues/new?assignees=&labels=type%3A+enhancement+%F0%9F%92%A1&template=feature-request-or-enhancement.md&title=)\n\n## Working in the open\n\nCarbon lives on GitHub. All work, discussion, issues, bugs, features,\nimprovements, and comments happen right out in the open where everyone can see.\nAs we mentioned, you'll need a [public GitHub account](https://github.com/join)\nto contribute.\n\nIf you're looking for something that we don't have, or you notice something\ncould be improved, you have two options:\n\n1. **Open an issue for the request.** We'll review the issue and get back to you\n   with next steps. If we decide the request should be part of our pipeline,\n   we'll add it to our roadmap. There are never timeline guarantees for\n   requests, but we'll do our best to give you an estimate.\n\n2. **Begin the work yourself and contribute it back to Carbon.** We appreciate\n   complete contributions but also works in progress. You're welcome to open an\n   issue to surface your work and we'll weigh in and help where we can.\n\nRegardless of how you choose to contribute, we encourage you to open an issue as\nearly as possible in the process.\n\nIf working with GitHub sounds like a lot, check out\n[this free video series](https://egghead.io/courses/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github).\nIt's one of our favorite resources.\n\n## The Carbon community\n\n### Users\n\nUsers are members of the community who use Carbon guidelines, assets, and\ntooling. Anyone can be a user, and we encourage users to participate in the\ncommunity as much as possible.\n\n### Contributors\n\nContributors are members of the community who contribute to Carbon in a material\nway. Anyone can be a contributor. In addition to participating as a user, you\ncan also contribute by:\n\n- Reporting bugs or missing features through GitHub issues\n- Fixing bugs, adding features, and improving documentation\n\n### Maintainers\n\nMaintainers are members of the community who are committed to the success of\nindividual Carbon projects. In addition to their participation as a contributor,\nmaintainers:\n\n- Label, close, and manage GitHub issues\n- Close and merge GitHub pull requests\n\n## Project workflow\n\nCarbon Design System projects typically use a\n[fork and pull request workflow](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/)\nfor contributions. Specific instructions can be found in each project’s GitHub\n`CONTRIBUTING.md` file.\n\n## Contributor License Agreement\n\nThe Carbon core team works for IBM. To accept contributions, we need a signed\nContributor License Agreement (CLA) from you before code contributions can be\nreviewed and merged. If you have questions, please don't hesitate\nto [reach out](/help/contact-us).\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"5b1d5898574eeaf5afa2a831489725b1","owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx","counter":3887},"frontmatter":{"title":"Overview","description":"Interested in contributing to Carbon?
