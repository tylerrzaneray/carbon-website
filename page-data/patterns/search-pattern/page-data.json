Most searches begin broad, with the scope\nnarrowing as filters are applied.\n\nThe method of search you use depends on the size of the data set being searched\nand the location of the search within your product.\n\nThe placement of your search field depends on the construction of your\napplication and the scope of the search. For global searches, see the\n[global header pattern](/patterns/global-header) for placement guidance. See the\n[data table](/components/data-table/usage#search) component for search placement\nwithin a data table.\n\n### Anatomy\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Anatomy of a basic search](/images/anatomy.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n1. **Scope filter (optional):** The optional scoped search allows users to limit\n   their searches to a section or category of content on a website.\n1. **Search icon:** Signifies a search field. The magnifying glass icon is a\n   universal way to indicate search.\n1. **Placeholder text:** Useful and short text hinting at what the user can\n   search for.

For example:\n            <UnorderedList>\n              — Searching a catalog\n              <br />\n              — Searching a small website\n              <br />\n              — Searching a small data set within a table\n              <br />— Searching a subset of information embedded within a product\n              or application’s page\n            </UnorderedList>\n          </StructuredListCell>\n        </StructuredListRow>\n        <StructuredListRow>\n          <StructuredListCell>\n            <a href=\"#focused-search\">Focused search</a>\n          </StructuredListCell>\n          <StructuredListCell>\n            When the search is focused on tasks or information specific to the\n            active user. Limits server load by focusing search scope while\n            offering the power of a broad, basic search.\n          </StructuredListCell>\n          <StructuredListCell>\n            <UnorderedList>\n              — Assigned tasks\n              <br />\n              — Product catalogs\n              <br />\n              — Personal repositories\n              <br />\n              — Work created by the active user\n              <br />\n            </UnorderedList>\n          </StructuredListCell>\n        </StructuredListRow>\n      </StructuredListBody>\n    </StructuredListWrapper>\n  </Column>\n</Row>\n\n### Best practices\n\n#### Avoid dead ends\n\nIf a search returns \"No results\", suggest a follow-up action. Provide\nsuggestions and helpful resources to aid the user in finding what they are\nlooking for. For more on no results for searches, see the\n[empty states pattern](/patterns/empty-states-pattern).\n\n#### Include a loading indicator\n\nIf the search will take longer than a moment or two, include a loading\nindicator. Your loading state should reflect your empty state with useful helper\ntext signaling that the search is still ongoing. Include a progress bar for\nadvanced, resource-intensive searches. Let the user know how far along the\nsearch is, and roughly how long it will take to finish.\n\n#### Display the number of results\n\nAlways include the number of search results, including for searches with no\nresults. If you plan to offer a scope filter, also include the number of results\nfor each scope selector.\n\n#### Don’t include a label\n\nAvoid adding a label to your search field. Users expect and understand search\nfields, and no label is necessary. A search icon along with useful placeholder\ntext should clearly indicate that the field is intended for search.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Provide useful placeholder text and include a search icon](./images/2_do.png)\n\n<Caption>Provide useful placeholder text and include a search icon.</Caption>\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Don’t include a label for search fields.](./images/2_dont.png)\n\n<Caption>Don’t include a label for search fields.</Caption>\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n#### Localize the search field\n\nFor languages that read right to left, flip the layout of the search box as\nshown in the next example.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Flip the layout of the search box for languages that read right to left instead of left to right](./images/do_hebrew.png)\n\n<Caption>\n  Example of a search box for languages that read right to left instead of left\n  to right\n</Caption>\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Flip the layout of the search box for languages that read right to left instead of left to right](./images/dont_hebrew.png)\n\n<Caption>\n  The search icon is recognized and acceptable across languages and countries.\n</Caption>\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n#### Add a scope filter to your search field\n\nThe optional scoped search allows users to limit their searches to a section or\ncategory of content on a website, as opposed to a global search that searches\neverything at once. Only one scoped category can be selected at a time, but the\ndropdown should always include an \"All\" or \"Any\" option, and this option should\nbe selected by default. With \"All\" or \"Any\" selected, the field will function as\na [basic global search](#basic-search).\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Example of a scope filter on a search field](/images/5.png)\n\n<Caption>Example of a scope filter on a search field</Caption>\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n## Basic search\n\nBasic search entails any search that directs users to a distinct results page.\nIn these instances, offer either trending searches that match the active user’s\nkeywords, recent searches by the active user, or both.\n\nA basic search does not actually query a data set until the user runs the\nsearch.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Example of basic search](/images/basic_search.png)\n\n<Caption>Example of a basic search field</Caption>\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n| When to use                          |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n| ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| _When searching is expensive_        | Searching a large body of information can be resource intensive and expensive, especially in instances where many users are searching the information simultaneously. Actively running the search after every character is entered or removed can be impractical. |\n| _When searching is slow_             | If the body of information is massive, actively searching can become too slow to be practical. Extended processing time following each character entered results in an application or website seeming unresponsive.                                               |\n| _When the information is unfamiliar_ | When users are searching an application or website they’re unfamiliar with, a dedicated search results page can give them a better idea of data structure and available resources.                                                                                |\n\n### Behaviors\n\n#### Recent search suggestions\n\nWhen a user clicks or tabs into a search field, they are be shown a menu of\neither the user’s recent searches, trending searches, or both. When the user\ntypes in the field, this menu is replaced with suggestions based on the search\nquery.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Example of recent search suggestions](/images/6.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n#### Type-ahead suggestions\n\nType-ahead suggestions are generated from ongoing analyses of use search\npatterns, and place minimal load on servers. Without committing to a search, the\nuser can see a preview of results, suggestions of additional search terms, or\nzero in on what they were looking for.\n\nType-ahead suggestions appear as soon as the user begins typing in the search\nfield.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Example of type-ahead suggestions](/images/7.png)\n\n<Caption>Example of type-ahead suggestions</Caption>\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n#### Results page\n\nOnce the user runs the search, they are directed to a distinct results page. On\nthis page, the user should have the option to select filters to narrow their\nsearch results. If you’d prefer to offer filters before the user searches,\nconsider adding a scope filter.\n\nThe design of the results page will depend largely on the needs of your product,\nand more specific design guidance for a search results page will be covered in\nfuture pattern guidance.\n\n## Active search\n\nAn active search is a rapid way to search an application or data set. The search\nruns after each character is entered, and results are shown immediately below\nthe search field. You can think of active search as a way to filter a dataset\nthrough keywords.\n\nAn active search is constructed from a search field, a search icon, and an X\nthat serves as a clear or cancel button. There is no Search or Go button, as the\nsearch is run actively and the user is not routed to a results page.\n\n![Example of an active search field](./images/active_search.png)\n\n<Caption>Example of an active search field</Caption>\n\n| When to use                         |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n| ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| _When data is limited_              | Active searches should be used in instances where the search is likely to return an accurate result, like a small website or data table with limited data. You can also use active search when looking through a catalog of items, like a product catalog or a library. |\n| _When users know what to look for_  | If users are familiar with a website or application, search will likely be used to find a resource the user knows exists. Actively returning results in the search results panel allows them to navigate directly to the page or resource.                              |\n| _When filtering an on-page catalog_ | If your product presents a catalog on a page, you can use an active search to refine options based on the query.                                                                                                                                                        |\n\n### Behaviors\n\n#### Search field\n\nActive search placeholder text should be more specific than a basic search and\nshould remain visible until the user begins typing in the search field. You can\noptionally add a \"See all results\" item to your results panel, which when\nclicked behaves as a [basic search](#basic-search).\n\nIf you are using active search for a catalog or library, refine the on-page\nresults as the user types.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Example of an active search field](./images/11.png)\n\n<Caption>Example of an active search field</Caption>\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n#### Presenting results\n\nActive search is intended to be a quicker search-in-place experience. The user\nshould find what they’re looking for in the results panel. Recent searches from\nthe active user should appear in a panel below the search field and should be\nreplaced by matching search results when the user begins typing.\n\nYou can also implement active search for a small set of information displayed on\na full page, like a catalog of offerings. Before the search is run, all items\nshould be displayed. Once the user begins typing, only show items that match the\nuser’s search.\n\n## Focused search\n\nA focused search is a combination of basic search and active search. The user is\n[actively shown results](#active-search) within their immediate page, product,\nor scope. Below those results, they have the option to widen their scope to\nsearch all available data.\n\nFocused search is ideal for users who are using a specific tool that is part of\na catalog or suite.\n\n![Example of focused search](/images/focused_search_full.png)\n\n<Caption>Example of a focused search with results panel</Caption>\n\n| When to use                   |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| _Within a product suite_      | A focused search can actively present results related to the active user. This limits the resources required for the search while still giving users the option to widen the scope of the search to an entire product catalog or database.                                                           |\n| _Within a folder or data set_ | Focused searches are ideal for searching within a folder or bucket, as the user can either further focus or expand the search through a data structure. If the results panel doesn’t deliver what the user needs, they can choose to search elsewhere without navigating away from the search field. |\n\n### Behaviors\n\n#### Search field\n\nA focused search queries for results related to the search’s focus, whether that\nis a user, a category, or a data set. The search results are presented in a\npanel just like in [active search](#active-search), but below the results an\noption to widen the scope and see a full page of search results is included.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Example of focused search](/images/11_focused_search.png)\n\n<Caption>Example of focused search</Caption>\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\nIf the user chooses a subcategory from the results panel, the search functions\nlike a [basic search](#basic-search) with a filter applied. Any selected filter\nshould persist during future searches until the user either discards the filter\nor begins a new session.\n\n#### Presenting results\n\nWhen the user clicks or tabs into the focused search field, a menu appears with\nrecent searches from the active user, suggestions specific to the user or\nsession, or both. When the user begins typing, the suggestions disappear and the\nresults are refined, following each character entered.\n\nYou can also cluster active results by category with the option to \"View all\"\nwithin the category. This is ideal for a user who may be searching within\nseveral similar data sets without knowing where the information lives. If the\nuser is likely to know the location of their data, offer a scope filter.\n\nA successful focused search will route a user directly to a page or resource. In\nthe event the user does select \"See all results\", present a results page. Always\ninclude the number of search results, including for searches with no results.\n\n## Accessibility\n\n### Search\n\nUsers should be able to `TAB` into the input field of the search box to begin\ntyping and press `ENTER` to run the search query.\n\nIf using a scope dropdown and/or type-ahead suggestions, those should also be\nnavigable by keyboard. For scope, `TAB` should select the dropdown and the\n`ARROW` keys should open it to cycle through the menu. `ENTER` should make a\nselection from the dropdown and advance the user to the input field of the\nsearch box.\n\nFor type-ahead suggestions, the `ARROW` keys should cycle through displayed\nsuggestions, with `ENTER` choosing a suggestion and `ESCAPE` allowing the user\nto exit the type-ahead menu without selecting anything.\n\n### Faceted filtering\n\nUsers should be able to `TAB` into the filter panel to cycle through the\ndifferent groups. Pressing `ENTER` moves the selection to the facets inside a\ngroup, allowing the user to move through the facets with the `ARROW` keys.\nPressing `ENTER` while a facet is in focus would toggle select or deselect the\nfacet.\n\nAfter a facet is selected or deselected, the focus state should be retained as\nthe content reloads, that way users don’t have to `TAB` through everything again\nas they move down the list.\n\n## Related\n\n<Row>\n<Column colSm={2} colMd={2} colLg={4}>\n\n#### Components\n\n- [Checkbox](/components/checkbox/usage)\n- [Date picker](/components/date-picker/usage)\n- [Modal](/components/modal/usage)\n- [Pagination](/components/pagination/usage)\n- [Search](/components/search/usage)\n- [Select](/components/button/usage#icon-usage)\n- [Text input](/components/text-input/usage)\n- [UI shell](/components/ui-shell-header/usage)\n\n</Column>\n<Column colSm={2} colMd={2} colLg={4}>\n\n#### Patterns\n\n- [Empty states](/patterns/empty-states-pattern)\n- [Filtering](/patterns/filtering)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n## References\n\n- Apple Human Interface Guidelines,\n  [Search Fields](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/macos/fields-and-labels/search-fields/)\n  (2019)\n- Nick Babich,\n  [Best Practices for Search Results](https://uxplanet.org/best-practices-for-search-results-1bbed9d7a311)\n  (2017)\n- Think with Google,\n  [In-App Search](https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/marketing-resources/experience-design/chapter-2-in-app-search/)\n  (2016)\n\n## Feedback\n\nHelp us improve this pattern by providing feedback, asking questions, and\nleaving any other comments\n[on GitHub](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-website/issues/new?assignees=&labels=feedback&template=feedback.md).\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"56e8dcf935d5f7508cd4a5c75b530195","owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx","counter":4096},"frontmatter":{"title":"Search","description":"Search enables users to specify a word or a phrase to find particular relevant pieces of content."},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: Search\ndescription:\n  Search enables users to specify a word or a phrase to find particular relevant\n  pieces of content.\n---\n\nimport {\n  StructuredListWrapper,\n  StructuredListHead,\n  StructuredListBody,\n  StructuredListRow,\n  StructuredListInput,\n  StructuredListCell,\n  OrderedList,\n  UnorderedList,\n  ListItem,\n} from '@carbon/react';\n\n<PageDescription>\n\nSearch is an essential pattern for navigation or discovery.

For example, “Search for networks or devices.”\n1. **Text entry field:** The place where a user enters their search query.\n\n### Types of search\n\n<Row>\n  <Column noGutterSm>\n    <StructuredListWrapper>\n      <StructuredListHead>\n        <StructuredListRow head>\n          <StructuredListCell head>Type</StructuredListCell>\n          <StructuredListCell head>When to use</StructuredListCell>\n          <StructuredListCell head>Use cases</StructuredListCell>\n        </StructuredListRow>\n      </StructuredListHead>\n      <StructuredListBody>\n        <StructuredListRow>\n          <StructuredListCell>\n            <a href=\"#basic-search\">Basic search</a>\n          </StructuredListCell>\n          <StructuredListCell>\n            When a user will conduct a search and be routed to a distinct\n            results page.\n          </StructuredListCell>\n          <StructuredListCell>\n            Global searches, or any search that routes users to a distinct\n            results page\n          </StructuredListCell>\n        </StructuredListRow>\n        <StructuredListRow>\n          <StructuredListCell>\n            <a href=\"#active-search\">Active search</a>\n          </StructuredListCell>\n          <StructuredListCell>\n            Best for small data sets, like a single page, website, or table.\n            When a user will benefit from constant feedback based on their\n            search query, and when the server can handle a substantial search\n            query load.\n          </StructuredListCell>\n          <StructuredListCell>\n            Actively searches a database and lists the top results in results\n            panel or on the current page. For example:\n            <UnorderedList>\n              — Searching a catalog\n              <br />\n              — Searching a small website\n              <br />\n              — Searching a small data set within a table\n              <br />— Searching a subset of information embedded within a product\n              or application’s page\n            </UnorderedList>\n          </StructuredListCell>\n        </StructuredListRow>\n        <StructuredListRow>\n          <StructuredListCell>\n            <a href=\"#focused-search\">Focused search</a>\n          </StructuredListCell>\n          <StructuredListCell>\n            When the search is focused on tasks or information specific to the\n            active user. Limits server load by focusing search scope while\n            offering the power of a broad, basic search.\n          </StructuredListCell>\n          <StructuredListCell>\n            <UnorderedList>\n              — Assigned tasks\n              <br />\n              — Product catalogs\n              <br />\n              — Personal repositories\n              <br />\n              — Work created by the active user\n              <br />\n            </UnorderedList>\n          </StructuredListCell>\n        </StructuredListRow>\n      </StructuredListBody>\n    </StructuredListWrapper>\n  </Column>\n</Row>\n\n### Best practices\n\n#### Avoid dead ends\n\nIf a search returns \"No results\", suggest a follow-up action. Provide\nsuggestions and helpful resources to aid the user in finding what they are\nlooking for. For more on no results for searches, see the\n[empty states pattern](/patterns/empty-states-pattern).\n\n#### Include a loading indicator\n\nIf the search will take longer than a moment or two, include a loading\nindicator. Your loading state should reflect your empty state with useful helper\ntext signaling that the search is still ongoing. Include a progress bar for\nadvanced, resource-intensive searches. Let the user know how far along the\nsearch is, and roughly how long it will take to finish.\n\n#### Display the number of results\n\nAlways include the number of search results, including for searches with no\nresults. If you plan to offer a scope filter, also include the number of results\nfor each scope selector.\n\n#### Don’t include a label\n\nAvoid adding a label to your search field. Users expect and understand search\nfields, and no label is necessary. A search icon along with useful placeholder\ntext should clearly indicate that the field is intended for search.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Provide useful placeholder text and include a search icon](./images/2_do.png)\n\n<Caption>Provide useful placeholder text and include a search icon.</Caption>\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Don’t include a label for search fields.](./images/2_dont.png)\n\n<Caption>Don’t include a label for search fields.</Caption>\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n#### Localize the search field\n\nFor languages that read right to left, flip the layout of the search box as\nshown in the next example.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Flip the layout of the search box for languages that read right to left instead of left to right](./images/do_hebrew.png)\n\n<Caption>\n  Example of a search box for languages that read right to left instead of left\n  to right\n</Caption>\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Flip the layout of the search box for languages that read right to left instead of left to right](./images/dont_hebrew.png)\n\n<Caption>\n  The search icon is recognized and acceptable across languages and countries.\n</Caption>\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n#### Add a scope filter to your search field\n\nThe optional scoped search allows users to limit their searches to a section or\ncategory of content on a website, as opposed to a global search that searches\neverything at once. Only one scoped category can be selected at a time, but the\ndropdown should always include an \"All\" or \"Any\" option, and this option should\nbe selected by default. With \"All\" or \"Any\" selected, the field will function as\na [basic global search](#basic-search).\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Example of a scope filter on a search field](/images/5.png)\n\n<Caption>Example of a scope filter on a search field</Caption>\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n## Basic search\n\nBasic search entails any search that directs users to a distinct results page.\nIn these instances, offer either trending searches that match the active user’s\nkeywords, recent searches by the active user, or both.\n\nA basic search does not actually query a data set until the user runs the\nsearch.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Example of basic search](/images/basic_search.png)\n\n<Caption>Example of a basic search field</Caption>\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n| When to use                          |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n| ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| _When searching is expensive_        | Searching a large body of information can be resource intensive and expensive, especially in instances where many users are searching the information simultaneously. Actively running the search after every character is entered or removed can be impractical. |\n| _When searching is slow_             | If the body of information is massive, actively searching can become too slow to be practical. Extended processing time following each character entered results in an application or website seeming unresponsive.                                               |\n| _When the information is unfamiliar_ | When users are searching an application or website they’re unfamiliar with, a dedicated search results page can give them a better idea of data structure and available resources.                                                                                |\n\n### Behaviors\n\n#### Recent search suggestions\n\nWhen a user clicks or tabs into a search field, they are be shown a menu of\neither the user’s recent searches, trending searches, or both. When the user\ntypes in the field, this menu is replaced with suggestions based on the search\nquery.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Example of recent search suggestions](/images/6.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n#### Type-ahead suggestions\n\nType-ahead suggestions are generated from ongoing analyses of use search\npatterns, and place minimal load on servers. Without committing to a search, the\nuser can see a preview of results, suggestions of additional search terms, or\nzero in on what they were looking for.\n\nType-ahead suggestions appear as soon as the user begins typing in the search\nfield.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Example of type-ahead suggestions](/images/7.png)\n\n<Caption>Example of type-ahead suggestions</Caption>\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n#### Results page\n\nOnce the user runs the search, they are directed to a distinct results page. On\nthis page, the user should have the option to select filters to narrow their\nsearch results. If you’d prefer to offer filters before the user searches,\nconsider adding a scope filter.\n\nThe design of the results page will depend largely on the needs of your product,\nand more specific design guidance for a search results page will be covered in\nfuture pattern guidance.\n\n## Active search\n\nAn active search is a rapid way to search an application or data set. The search\nruns after each character is entered, and results are shown immediately below\nthe search field. You can think of active search as a way to filter a dataset\nthrough keywords.\n\nAn active search is constructed from a search field, a search icon, and an X\nthat serves as a clear or cancel button. There is no Search or Go button, as the\nsearch is run actively and the user is not routed to a results page.\n\n![Example of an active search field](./images/active_search.png)\n\n<Caption>Example of an active search field</Caption>\n\n| When to use                         |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |\n| ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| _When data is limited_              | Active searches should be used in instances where the search is likely to return an accurate result, like a small website or data table with limited data. You can also use active search when looking through a catalog of items, like a product catalog or a library. |\n| _When users know what to look for_  | If users are familiar with a website or application, search will likely be used to find a resource the user knows exists. Actively returning results in the search results panel allows them to navigate directly to the page or resource.                              |\n| _When filtering an on-page catalog_ | If your product presents a catalog on a page, you can use an active search to refine options based on the query.                                                                                                                                                        |\n\n### Behaviors\n\n#### Search field\n\nActive search placeholder text should be more specific than a basic search and\nshould remain visible until the user begins typing in the search field. You can\noptionally add a \"See all results\" item to your results panel, which when\nclicked behaves as a [basic search](#basic-search).\n\nIf you are using active search for a catalog or library, refine the on-page\nresults as the user types.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Example of an active search field](./images/11.png)\n\n<Caption>Example of an active search field</Caption>\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n#### Presenting results\n\nActive search is intended to be a quicker search-in-place experience. The user\nshould find what they’re looking for in the results panel. Recent searches from\nthe active user should appear in a panel below the search field and should be\nreplaced by matching search results when the user begins typing.\n\nYou can also implement active search for a small set of information displayed on\na full page, like a catalog of offerings. Before the search is run, all items\nshould be displayed. Once the user begins typing, only show items that match the\nuser’s search.\n\n## Focused search\n\nA focused search is a combination of basic search and active search. The user is\n[actively shown results](#active-search) within their immediate page, product,\nor scope. Below those results, they have the option to widen their scope to\nsearch all available data.\n\nFocused search is ideal for users who are using a specific tool that is part of\na catalog or suite.\n\n![Example of focused search](/images/focused_search_full.png)\n\n<Caption>Example of a focused search with results panel</Caption>\n\n| When to use                   |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |\n| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| _Within a product suite_      | A focused search can actively present results related to the active user. This limits the resources required for the search while still giving users the option to widen the scope of the search to an entire product catalog or database.                                                           |\n| _Within a folder or data set_ | Focused searches are ideal for searching within a folder or bucket, as the user can either further focus or expand the search through a data structure. If the results panel doesn’t deliver what the user needs, they can choose to search elsewhere without navigating away from the search field. |\n\n### Behaviors\n\n#### Search field\n\nA focused search queries for results related to the search’s focus, whether that\nis a user, a category, or a data set. The search results are presented in a\npanel just like in [active search](#active-search), but below the results an\noption to widen the scope and see a full page of search results is included.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Example of focused search](/images/11_focused_search.png)\n\n<Caption>Example of focused search</Caption>\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\nIf the user chooses a subcategory from the results panel, the search functions\nlike a [basic search](#basic-search) with a filter applied. Any selected filter\nshould persist during future searches until the user either discards the filter\nor begins a new session.\n\n#### Presenting results\n\nWhen the user clicks or tabs into the focused search field, a menu appears with\nrecent searches from the active user, suggestions specific to the user or\nsession, or both. When the user begins typing, the suggestions disappear and the\nresults are refined, following each character entered.\n\nYou can also cluster active results by category with the option to \"View all\"\nwithin the category. This is ideal for a user who may be searching within\nseveral similar data sets without knowing where the information lives. If the\nuser is likely to know the location of their data, offer a scope filter.\n\nA successful focused search will route a user directly to a page or resource. In\nthe event the user does select \"See all results\", present a results page. Always\ninclude the number of search results, including for searches with no results.\n\n## Accessibility\n\n### Search\n\nUsers should be able to `TAB` into the input field of the search box to begin\ntyping and press `ENTER` to run the search query.\n\nIf using a scope dropdown and/or type-ahead suggestions, those should also be\nnavigable by keyboard. For scope, `TAB` should select the dropdown and the\n`ARROW` keys should open it to cycle through the menu. `ENTER` should make a\nselection from the dropdown and advance the user to the input field of the\nsearch box.\n\nFor type-ahead suggestions, the `ARROW` keys should cycle through displayed\nsuggestions, with `ENTER` choosing a suggestion and `ESCAPE` allowing the user\nto exit the type-ahead menu without selecting anything.\n\n### Faceted filtering\n\nUsers should be able to `TAB` into the filter panel to cycle through the\ndifferent groups. Pressing `ENTER` moves the selection to the facets inside a\ngroup, allowing the user to move through the facets with the `ARROW` keys.\nPressing `ENTER` while a facet is in focus would toggle select or deselect the\nfacet.\n\nAfter a facet is selected or deselected, the focus state should be retained as\nthe content reloads, that way users don’t have to `TAB` through everything again\nas they move down the list.\n\n## Related\n\n<Row>\n<Column colSm={2} colMd={2} colLg={4}>\n\n#### Components\n\n- [Checkbox](/components/checkbox/usage)\n- [Date picker](/components/date-picker/usage)\n- [Modal](/components/modal/usage)\n- [Pagination](/components/pagination/usage)\n- [Search](/components/search/usage)\n- [Select](/components/button/usage#icon-usage)\n- [Text input](/components/text-input/usage)\n- [UI shell](/components/ui-shell-header/usage)\n\n</Column>\n<Column colSm={2} colMd={2} colLg={4}>\n\n#### Patterns\n\n- [Empty states](/patterns/empty-states-pattern)\n- [Filtering](/patterns/filtering)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n## References\n\n- Apple Human Interface Guidelines,\n  [Search Fields](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/macos/fields-and-labels/search-fields/)\n  (2019)\n- Nick Babich,\n  [Best Practices for Search Results](https://uxplanet.org/best-practices-for-search-results-1bbed9d7a311)\n  (2017)\n- Think with Google,\n  [In-App Search](https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/marketing-resources/experience-design/chapter-2-in-app-search/)\n  (2016)\n\n## Feedback\n\nHelp us improve this pattern by providing feedback, asking questions, and\nleaving any other comments\n[on GitHub](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-website/issues/new?assignees=&labels=feedback&template=feedback.md).\n","fileAbsolutePath":"/home/runner/work/carbon-website/carbon-website/src/pages/patterns/search-pattern/index.mdx"}}},
