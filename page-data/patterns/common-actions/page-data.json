For\nplatform consistency, these actions should only be applied in the ways described\nbelow.\n\n</PageDescription>\n\n<AnchorLinks>\n\n<AnchorLink>Add</AnchorLink>\n<AnchorLink>Cancel</AnchorLink>\n<AnchorLink>Clear</AnchorLink>\n<AnchorLink>Close</AnchorLink>\n<AnchorLink>Copy</AnchorLink>\n<AnchorLink>Delete</AnchorLink>\n<AnchorLink>Edit</AnchorLink>\n<AnchorLink>Errors</AnchorLink>\n<AnchorLink>Next</AnchorLink>\n<AnchorLink>Refresh</AnchorLink>\n<AnchorLink>Remove</AnchorLink>\n<AnchorLink>Reset</AnchorLink>\n\n</AnchorLinks>\n\n## Add\n\nAdd inserts an existing object to a list, set, or system. For example, adding a\ndocument to a folder.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Example of add as a button with an icon in a data table](images/common-action-7.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n### Hierarchy and placement\n\nDepending on the importance of the add action on the page, the emphasis can be\nhigh, medium, or low. For example, a high emphasis action should use a single\nprimary button with all others being secondary.\n\n### Considerations\n\nSmall adjustments in your messaging will reduce user uncertainty. Consider the\nfollowing:\n\n- What are the implications of the add action for the user? Are there financial,\n  access, or legal considerations?\n- Does the user have the correct permissions for this action?\n- Is the action permanent?\n- What timeframe will the action take (seconds, minutes, hours, days)?\n- What should a user do if the action fails?\n- Is this a single or bulk action?\n\n## Cancel\n\nCancel stops the current action and closes the component or item. Warn the user\nof any negative consequences if the process doesn’t progress, such as data\ncorruption or data loss.\n\nUse a secondary button or a link for cancel actions.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Example of cancel in a modal](images/common-action-1.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n## Clear\n\nClear removes data from a field or removes selections. Clear can also delete the\ncontents of a document, such as a log. For controls that have a default\nselection or value, such as radio buttons, the default selection or value is\nreset.\n\nUse the `close` icon on the right side of a field, item, or value.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Example of clear in multiselect dropdown and in a search field](images/common-action-2.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n## Close\n\nClose terminates the current page, window, or menu. Close is also used to\ndismiss information, such as notifications.\n\nUse the `close` icon, which is typically placed on the upper right side of the\nelement. Do not use close in a button.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Example of close in an toast notification](images/common-action-3.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n## Copy\n\nCopy creates a new identical instance of the selected object(s).\n\nUse the `copy` icon with a confirmation \"copied\" tooltip appearing post-click or\ntap.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Example of copy in a code snippet](images/common-action-8.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n## Delete\n\nDelete destroys an object. Delete actions cannot be easily undone and are\ntypically permanent. Warn the user of any negative consequences if an object is\ndestroyed, such as loss of data. Use either the `delete` or `trash can` icon, a\ndanger button, or a danger option in a menu. A danger modal is used when a\nwarning is needed to confirm an action.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Example of delete in a modal and overflow menu](images/common-action-4.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n### Low-impact deletion\n\nUse when it’s trivial to undo deletion or recreate the data. Delete the data\nupon click or tap without further warning.\n\n### Moderate-impact deletion\n\nUse when an action cannot be undone or the data cannot be recreated easily. This\npattern is also useful if you’re deleting more than one thing.\n\nAsk for confirmation of the delete, with guidance about what will occur if they\ndelete.\n\n### High-impact deletion\n\nUse when it would be very expensive or time-consuming to recreate data. Also use\nif the action deletes a large amount of data, or if other important items would\nbe deleted as a result of the action.\n\nIn addition to presenting a dialog, have the user type the name of the resource\nthey are deleting (manual confirmation).\n\n### Post-deletion\n\nAfter the user deletes data, return to the page that lists the data deleted.\nAnimate the removal of the data from the list or page and present a success\nnotification.\n\nIf the deletion fails, raise a notification to tell the user that deletion\nfailed. Send a second notification on another communication channel, like email,\nif possible. Animate the data back onto the page if possible.\n\n## Edit\n\nEdit allows data or values to be changed. Edit commonly triggers a state change\nto the targeted object or input item.\n\nOffer edit as an option in a menu, or as a button or `edit` icon.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Example of edit in a data table cell](images/common-action-9.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Example of edit in an overflow menu](images/common-action-10.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n## Errors\n\nErrors occur when an action or process does not succeed. Error notifications can\noccupy full pages, form fields, notifications, and modals. Error notifications\nshould provide context of what happened and a clear path to continue.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Form example with inline notification](images/notification-usage-3.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\nConsider redirecting the user to a previous state, a support page, or offering\nrecommendations. Be honest and helpful.\n\nSome components, like text input and form field errors, are quite small and\nrequire more thoughtful approaches to the space and placement of error handling.\nConsider inline error notifications for these instances.\n\n### Content guidelines\n\nBe brief, honest, and supportive. Explain what happened and what can the user do\nto resolve the error.\n\nFor full-page and large modals, keep error messages no longer than three\nparagraph lines. For form errors, keep error messages no longer than two lines.\n\n## Next\n\nNext advances the user to the next step in a sequence of steps, like in a\nwizard.\n\nRepresent next with a [button with icon](/components/button/usage) or a\nstandalone `forward` icon.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Example of next as a button with icon](images/common-action-11.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n## Refresh\n\nThis action reloads the view of an object, list, or data set when the displayed\nview has become unsynchronized with the source.\n\nUse the `refresh` icon or a button.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Example of edit in a data table cell](images/common-action-12.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n## Remove\n\nThis action removes an object from a list or item. Remove is distinct from\ndelete, as a removed item is not destroyed. Multiple objects can be removed at\nonce.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Example of remove in a structured list](images/common-action-5.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n### Hierarchy and placement\n\nRepresent remove as a button or `subtract` icon or glyph. The remove action is\nrarely the primary action on the page and should not be overly emphasized.\n\n### Considerations\n\n- What are the implications of the remove action for the user? Are there\n  financial, access, or legal considerations?\n- This action can be confused with deleting.\n- A user may not have the correct permissions for this action.\n- Inform the user if the result is permanent.\n- How long will the action take? Seconds, minutes, hours, or days?\n- What should the user do if the removal fails?\n- Is this a single or bulk action?\n\n## Reset\n\nReset reverts values back to their last saved state. The last saved state\nincludes the values stored the last time the user clicked or triggered\n**Apply**.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\nReset is typically applied as a link.\n\n![Example of reset in a filter](images/common-action-6.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"ffac431c8d8ef562d4b987a84331ed53","owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx","counter":4079},"frontmatter":{"title":"Common actions","description":"Common actions are frequently used actions that appear across different components and workflows."},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: Common actions\ndescription:\n  Common actions are frequently used actions that appear across different\n  components and workflows.\n---\n\n<PageDescription>\n\nCommon actions frequently appear across different components and workflows.
