We have plans to open source it in the near future.\n\nThe design system contains selected components from the Carbon Design System,\nCarbon for IBM.com, and Carbon for IBM Products, along with custom components\nbespoke to Salesforce platform products.\n\nWithin IBM, C4S is used by the Cognitive Support Platform project with\n`ibm.com/support` being the client facing experience of IBM Support. We're also\njust kicking off the use of C4S on IBM Partner Portal.\n\n### List of available components\n\nWe are starting to develop components based on Carbon v11 in 2022 Q2. The source\ncode and setup instructions can be found on the\n[GitHub respository](https://github.ibm.com/carbon-for-salesforce/carbon-for-salesforce).\n\nSee list of available components in\n[Storybook](https://pages.github.ibm.com/carbon-for-salesforce/carbon-for-salesforce/).\n\nAdditional documentation is available in\n[ISC Playbook](https://isc-playbook.mybluemix.net/#/documents/b92d2ed082c108d76ee91887234558c9).\n\n## Getting started\n\n### 1. Install the Salesforce CLI\n\n- [Mac OS](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.sfdx_setup.meta/sfdx_setup/sfdx_setup_install_cli.htm#sfdx_setup_install_cli_macos)\n- [Windows](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.sfdx_setup.meta/sfdx_setup/sfdx_setup_install_cli.htm#sfdx_setup_install_cli_windows)\n- [TAR](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.sfdx_setup.meta/sfdx_setup/sfdx_setup_install_cli.htm#sfdx_setup_install_cli_linux)\n- [NPM](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.sfdx_setup.meta/sfdx_setup/sfdx_setup_install_cli.htm#sfdx_setup_install_cli_npm)\n\nVerify your installation with\n\n```\nsfdx --version\n```\n\n### 2. Get Visual Studio Code Plugins\n\n- [Salesforce Extension Pack](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=salesforce.salesforcedx-vscode)\n- [Lightning Web Components](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=salesforce.salesforcedx-vscode)\n\nCheck that our environment is ready for creating Lightning Web Components by\npressing Command + Shift + P on macOS or Ctrl + Shift + P on Windows and type\n`sfdx`.\n\n### 3. Set up LWC Local Development Server\n\nLearn more about the `lwc-dev-server` plugin at official\n[documentation](https://developer.salesforce.com/tools/vscode/en/localdev/set-up-lwc-local-dev).\n\n```\nsfdx plugins:install @salesforce/lwc-dev-server\n```\n\n### 4. Authenticate against Salesforce Developer Sandbox\n\n```\nsfdx force:auth:web:login -a \"<NAME-OF-SANDBOX>\" -r https://<NAME-OF-SANDBOX>.my.salesforce.com/ -s\n```\n\n### 5. Clone project and install dependencies\n\nClone the repository using an SSH key. Alternatively, HTTPS should work too.\n\n```\ngit clone git@github.ibm.com:carbon-for-salesforce/carbon-for-salesforce.git\n```\n\nThen navigate to the project folder\n\n```\ncd carbon-for-salesforce\n```\n\nInstall dependencies with either `npm` or `yarn`.\n\nPlease note, recommended Node.js version is `v16`. To switch between node\nversions we recommend <a href=\"https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm\">NVM (Node Version\nManager)</a>.\n\n```\nnpm install\n\nor\n\nyarn\n```\n\n### 6. Working with Storybook\n\nAll commands below works if `npm run` is replaced with `yarn`.\n\nStart storybook\n\n```\nnpm run storybook\n```\n\nBuild Storybook\n\n```\nnpm run build-storybook\n```\n\nDeploy Storybook\n\n```\nnpm run deploy-storybook\n```\n\nRun unit tests\n\n```\nnpm test\n\nor\n\nyarn test\n```\n\n### 7. Start local lwc development server\n\n```\nnpm start\n\nor\n\nyarn start\n```\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\nIf you experience any issues while getting set up with Carbon LWC components,\nplease head over to the\n[GitHub repository](https://github.ibm.com/carbon-for-salesforce/carbon-for-salesforce)\nfor more guidelines and support. Please\n[create an issue](https://github.ibm.com/carbon-for-salesforce/carbon-for-salesforce/issues/new)\nif your issue does not already exist.\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"d6f23190dc9c70f19c681d696361d1c8","owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx","counter":4026},"frontmatter":{"title":"Frameworks","description":"The Carbon Design System is built React first, with official support for Web Components.
