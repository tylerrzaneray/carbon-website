So far, we've only used Carbon components to build out two\npages.\n\nNext, we're going to use Carbon assets to build application-specific components.\nWe'll do so by including accessibility and responsive considerations all\nthroughout.\n\nA [preview](https://react-step-5--carbon-tutorial.netlify.com) of what you'll\nbuild (see bottom of page):\n\n<Preview\n  height=\"400\"\n  title=\"Carbon Tutorial Step 4\"\n  src=\"https://react-step-5--carbon-tutorial.netlify.com\"\n  frameborder=\"no\"\n  allowtransparency=\"true\"\n  allowfullscreen=\"true\"\n/>\n\n## Fork, clone and branch\n\nThis tutorial has an accompanying GitHub repository called\n[carbon-tutorial](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-tutorial) that\nwe'll use as a starting point for each step. If you haven't forked and cloned\nthat repository yet, and haven't added the upstream remote, go ahead and do so\nby following the\n[step 1 instructions](/developing/react-tutorial/step-1#fork-clone-and-branch).\n\n### Branch\n\nWith your repository all set up, let's check out the branch for this tutorial\nstep's starting point.\n\n```bash\ngit fetch upstream\ngit checkout -b v11-react-step-4 upstream/v11-react-step-4\n```\n\n<InlineNotification>\n\n**Note:** This builds on top of step 3, but be sure to check out the upstream\nstep 4 branch because it includes the static assets required to get through this\nstep.\n\n</InlineNotification>\n\n### Build and start app\n\nInstall the app's dependencies (in case you're starting fresh in your current\ndirectory and not continuing from the previous step):\n\n```bash\nyarn\n```\n\nThen, start the app:\n\n```bash\nyarn start\n```\n\nYou should see something similar to where the\n[previous step](/developing/react-tutorial/step-3) left off.\n\n## Review design\n\nHere's what we're building – an informational section that has a heading and\nthree subheadings. Each subheading has accompanying copy and a pictogram. We'll\nassume that this informational section is used elsewhere on the site, meaning\nit's a great opportunity to build it as a reusable component. As for naming,\nwe'll call it an `InfoSection` with three `InfoCard`s as children.\n\n![Info section layout](../shared/step-4/images/info-layout.png)\n\n<Caption>Info section layout</Caption>\n\n## Create components\n\nFirst we need files for the components, so create an `Info` folder in\n`src/components`. Even though we're building multiple components, their names\nall start with `Info`, so it makes sense to have them share one folder in\ncomponents. Create these files:\n\n### Add files\n\n```bash\nsrc/components/Info\n├──_info.scss\n├──index.js\n└──Info.js\n```\n\nImport `_info.scss` in `app.scss` after all of the `tutorial-header.scss`\nimport.\n\n```scss path=src/app.scss\n@use './components/Info/info';\n```\n\nLike our other components, `index.js` will serve as an entrypoint. Since\n`Info.js` will export multiple components, we'll use the `*` wildcard in the\nentrypoint export.\n\n```javascript path=src/components/Info/index.js\nexport * from './Info';\n```\n\n### InfoSection component\n\nLet's create the parent component that includes the \"The Principles\" heading.\nThat markup currently looks like this in `LandingPage.js`:\n\n```jsx path=src/content/LandingPage/LandingPage.js\n<Column lg={16} md={8} sm={4} className=\"landing-page__r3\">\n  <Grid>\n    <Column md={4} lg={4}>\n      <h3 className=\"landing-page__label\">The Principles</h3>\n    </Column>\n    <Column md={4} lg={4}>\n      Carbon is Open\n    </Column>\n    <Column md={4} lg={4}>\n      Carbon is Modular\n    </Column>\n    <Column md={4} lg={4}>\n      Carbon is Consistent\n    </Column>\n  </Grid>\n</Column>\n```\n\nWe want to do a few things when abstracting it to a component. First, we only\nwant this component's class names; we don't want to include `landing-page__r3`\nas that's specific to the landing page. For that we'll use React `props` so we\ncan pass in and use `props.className`.\n\nWe'll also:\n\n- Add component class names like `info-section`, `info-card`, and\n  `info-section__heading`\n- We will be using the `Grid` and `Column` components\n- Replace `The Principles` with `{props.heading}`\n- Replace columns 2 - 4 with `{props.children}`\n\nUsing `props` we can render any heading and any number of children components\n(`InfoCard` that we'll build soon.)\n\n```javascript path=src/components/Info/Info.js\nimport React from 'react';\nimport { Grid, Column } from '@carbon/react';\n\nconst InfoSection = (props) => (\n  <Grid className={`${props.className} info-section`}>\n    <Column md={8} lg={4} xlg={3}>\n      <h3 className=\"info-section__heading\">{props.heading}</h3>\n    </Column>\n    {props.children}\n  </Grid>\n);\n```\n\nAt this point let's import our needed styles and add styling for the new class\nnames that we just added.\n\n```scss path=src/components/Info/_info.scss\n@use '@carbon/react/scss/type' as *;\n\n.info-section__heading {\n  @include type-style('heading-01');\n}\n```\n\n### InfoCard component\n\nNext up we're going to build a component for columns 2 - 4, which currently\nlooks like `<Column md={4} lg={4}>Carbon is Open</Column>`. At the bottom of\n`Info.js`, add:\n\n```javascript path=src/components/Info/Info.js\nconst InfoCard = (props) => {\n  return (\n    <Column sm={4} md={8} lg={4} className=\"info-card\">\n      <h4 className=\"info-card__heading\">{props.heading}</h4>\n      <p className=\"info-card__body\">{props.body}</p>\n      {props.icon()}\n    </Column>\n  );\n};\n\nexport { InfoSection, InfoCard };\n```\n\n<InlineNotification>\n\n**Note:** Make sure to export the two components!\n\n</InlineNotification>\n\nIn doing so, we:\n\n- Added `info-card` classes\n- Used `props` to render the heading, body copy, and icon\n- Set columns to match the grid\n\n## Use components\n\nNothing is styled yet, but with our components built let's put them to use. In\n`LandingPage.js`, import the components towards the top of the file.\n\n```javascript path=src/content/LandingPage/LandingPage.js\nimport { InfoSection, InfoCard } from '../../components/Info';\n```\n\nWhile we're at the top of `LandingPage.js`, import the icons that we'll need as\nwell.\n\n```javascript path=src/content/LandingPage/LandingPage.js\nimport { Globe, Application, PersonFavorite } from '@carbon/react/icons';\n```\n\nWith everything imported, replace the current:\n\n```jsx path=src/content/LandingPage/LandingPage.js\n<Grid>\n  <Column md={4} lg={4}>\n    <h3 className=\"landing-page__label\">The Principles</h3>\n  </Column>\n  <Column md={4} lg={4}>\n    Carbon is Open\n  </Column>\n  <Column md={4} lg={4}>\n    Carbon is Modular\n  </Column>\n  <Column md={4} lg={4}>\n    Carbon is Consistent\n  </Column>\n</Grid>\n```\n\nWith the new components:\n\n```javascript path=src/content/LandingPage/LandingPage.js\n<InfoSection heading=\"The Principles\" className=\"landing-page__r3\">\n  <InfoCard\n    heading=\"Carbon is Open\"\n    body=\"It's a distributed effort, guided by the principles of the open-source movement. Carbon's users are also it's makers, and everyone is encouraged to contribute.\"\n    icon={() => <PersonFavorite size={32} />}\n  />\n  <InfoCard\n    heading=\"Carbon is Modular\"\n    body=\"Carbon's modularity ensures maximum flexibility in execution. It's components are designed to work seamlessly with each other, in whichever combination suits the needs of the user.\"\n    icon={() => <Application size={32} />}\n  />\n  <InfoCard\n    heading=\"Carbon is Consistent\"\n    body=\"Based on the comprehensive IBM Design Language, every element and component of Carbon was designed from the ground up to work elegantly together to ensure consistent, cohesive user experiences.\"\n    icon={() => <Globe size={32} />}\n  />\n</InfoSection>\n```\n\n<InlineNotification>\n\n**Note:** Now is a good time to resize your browser from phone to large viewport\nwidths to see how the responsive grid is working before we add further styling.\n\n</InlineNotification>\n\n## Add styling\n\nHere's our design showing the spacing tokens that we need to add. We also need\nto set type style and borders.\n\n![Info section spacing](../shared/step-4/images/info-spacing.png)\n\n### Layout\n\nStarting with layout, import the following carbon styles to\n`src/components/Info/_info.scss`. Make sure to import the needed carbon styles.\n\n```scss path=src/components/Info/_info.scss\n@use '@carbon/react/scss/spacing' as *;\n@use '@carbon/react/scss/breakpoint' as *;\n@use '@carbon/react/scss/theme' as *;\n```\n\nWe will then add the following styles to the same file to style our info cards.\n\n```scss path=src/components/Info/_info.scss\n.info-card {\n  margin-top: $spacing-09;\n  display: flex;\n  flex-direction: column;\n  padding-left: 1rem;\n\n  svg {\n    margin-top: $spacing-09;\n  }\n\n  // top border in only small breakpoints to prevent overrides\n  @include breakpoint-down(md) {\n    &:not(:nth-child(2)) {\n      border-top: 1px solid $border-subtle-01;\n      padding-top: $spacing-09;\n    }\n  }\n\n  // left border in just the 2nd column items\n  @include breakpoint(md) {\n    &:nth-child(odd) {\n      border-left: 1px solid $border-subtle-01;\n    }\n  }\n\n  // left border in all items\n  @include breakpoint(lg) {\n    margin-top: 0;\n    border-left: 1px solid $border-subtle-01;\n\n    svg {\n      margin-top: $spacing-12;\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nOnce you save, go ahead and resize your browser to see the responsive layout at\nthe different breakpoints. Make sure to review these color and spacing tokens.\nThere are also a few breakpoint mixins that may be new to you.\n\n### Type\n\nOur `InfoCard` headings look to be too small. We need to increase their font\nsizes according to the design spec. Lets update the heading with the following\ntype style:\n\n```scss path=src/components/Info/_info.scss\n.info-card__heading {\n  @include type-style('productive-heading-03');\n}\n```\n\nAlso, the design has the last word in each subheading as bold. To accomplish\nthat, add this helper function after the import in `Info.js`.\n\n```javascript path=src/components/Info/Info.js\n// Take in a phrase and separate the third word in an array\nfunction createArrayFromPhrase(phrase) {\n  const splitPhrase = phrase.split(' ');\n  const thirdWord = splitPhrase.pop();\n  return [splitPhrase.join(' '), thirdWord];\n}\n```\n\nThen, update `InfoCard` to use `createArrayFromPhrase`.\n\n```javascript path=src/components/Info/Info.js\nconst InfoCard = (props) => {\n  const splitHeading = createArrayFromPhrase(props.heading);\n\n  return (\n    <Column sm={4} md={8} lg={4} className=\"info-card\">\n      <h4 className=\"info-card__heading\">\n        {`${splitHeading[0]} `}\n        <strong>{splitHeading[1]}</strong>\n      </h4>\n      <p className=\"info-card__body\">{props.body}</p>\n      {props.icon()}\n    </Column>\n  );\n};\n```\n\nFinally, add the declaration block in `_info.scss` to set `InfoCard` body copy\nstyles and to bottom-align the icons.\n\n```scss path=src/components/Info/_info.scss\n.info-card__body {\n  margin-top: $spacing-06;\n  flex-grow: 1; // fill space so icons are bottom aligned\n  @include type-style('body-long-01');\n\n  // prevent large line lengths between small and medium viewports\n  @include breakpoint-between(321px, md) {\n    max-width: 75%;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Check accessibility\n\nWe've added new markup and styles, so it's a good practice to check\n[Equal Access Checker](https://www.ibm.com/able/toolkit/tools/) and make sure\nour rendered markup is on the right track for accessibility.\n\nWith the browser extension installed, Chrome in this example, open Dev Tools and\nrun Accessibility Assessment.\n\n## Submit pull request\n\nWe're going to submit a pull request to verify completion of this tutorial step.\n\n### Continuous integration (CI) check\n\nRun the CI check to make sure we're all set to submit a pull request.\n\n```bash\nyarn ci-check\n```\n\n<InlineNotification>\n\n**Note:** Having issues running the CI check?\n[Step 1](</developing/react-tutorial/step-1#continuous-integration-(ci)-check>)\nhas troubleshooting notes that may help.\n\n</InlineNotification>\n\n### Git commit and push\n\nBefore we can create a pull request, format your code, then stage and commit all\nof your changes:\n\n```bash\nyarn format\ngit add --all && git commit -m \"feat(tutorial): complete step 4\"\n```\n\nThen, push to your repository:\n\n```bash\ngit push origin v11-react-step-4\n```\n\n<InlineNotification>\n\n**Note:** Having issues pushing your changes?\n[Step 1](/developing/react-tutorial/step-1#git-commit-and-push) has\ntroubleshooting notes that may help.\n\n</InlineNotification>\n\n### Pull request (PR)\n\nFinally, visit\n[carbon-tutorial](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-tutorial) to\n\"Compare & pull request\". In doing so, make sure that you are comparing to\n`v11-react-step-4` into `base: v11-react-step-4`.\n\n<InlineNotification>\n\n**Note:** Expect your tutorial step PRs to be reviewed by the Carbon team but\nnot merged. We'll close your PR so we can keep the repository's remote branches\npristine and ready for the next person!\n\n</InlineNotification>\n\n<InlineNotification>\n\n**Note:** If your PR fails the CircleCI test with the error\n`Can't make a request in offline mode`, try running the following command:\n`rm -rf .yarn-offline-mirror node_modules && yarn cache clean && yarn install`.\nAdd and commit the changes once this completes, and try pushing again.\n\n</InlineNotification>\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"f4f6643b240cb9ac3b433e8eec3ac45d","owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx","counter":4095},"frontmatter":{"title":"4.

Make sure to import the needed carbon styles.\n\n```scss path=src/components/Info/_info.scss\n@use '@carbon/react/scss/spacing' as *;\n@use '@carbon/react/scss/breakpoint' as *;\n@use '@carbon/react/scss/theme' as *;\n```\n\nWe will then add the following styles to the same file to style our info cards.\n\n```scss path=src/components/Info/_info.scss\n.info-card {\n  margin-top: $spacing-09;\n  display: flex;\n  flex-direction: column;\n  padding-left: 1rem;\n\n  svg {\n    margin-top: $spacing-09;\n  }\n\n  // top border in only small breakpoints to prevent overrides\n  @include breakpoint-down(md) {\n    &:not(:nth-child(2)) {\n      border-top: 1px solid $border-subtle-01;\n      padding-top: $spacing-09;\n    }\n  }\n\n  // left border in just the 2nd column items\n  @include breakpoint(md) {\n    &:nth-child(odd) {\n      border-left: 1px solid $border-subtle-01;\n    }\n  }\n\n  // left border in all items\n  @include breakpoint(lg) {\n    margin-top: 0;\n    border-left: 1px solid $border-subtle-01;\n\n    svg {\n      margin-top: $spacing-12;\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nOnce you save, go ahead and resize your browser to see the responsive layout at\nthe different breakpoints. Make sure to review these color and spacing tokens.\nThere are also a few breakpoint mixins that may be new to you.\n\n### Type\n\nOur `InfoCard` headings look to be too small. We need to increase their font\nsizes according to the design spec. Lets update the heading with the following\ntype style:\n\n```scss path=src/components/Info/_info.scss\n.info-card__heading {\n  @include type-style('productive-heading-03');\n}\n```\n\nAlso, the design has the last word in each subheading as bold. To accomplish\nthat, add this helper function after the import in `Info.js`.\n\n```javascript path=src/components/Info/Info.js\n// Take in a phrase and separate the third word in an array\nfunction createArrayFromPhrase(phrase) {\n  const splitPhrase = phrase.split(' ');\n  const thirdWord = splitPhrase.pop();\n  return [splitPhrase.join(' '), thirdWord];\n}\n```\n\nThen, update `InfoCard` to use `createArrayFromPhrase`.\n\n```javascript path=src/components/Info/Info.js\nconst InfoCard = (props) => {\n  const splitHeading = createArrayFromPhrase(props.heading);\n\n  return (\n    <Column sm={4} md={8} lg={4} className=\"info-card\">\n      <h4 className=\"info-card__heading\">\n        {`${splitHeading[0]} `}\n        <strong>{splitHeading[1]}</strong>\n      </h4>\n      <p className=\"info-card__body\">{props.body}</p>\n      {props.icon()}\n    </Column>\n  );\n};\n```\n\nFinally, add the declaration block in `_info.scss` to set `InfoCard` body copy\nstyles and to bottom-align the icons.\n\n```scss path=src/components/Info/_info.scss\n.info-card__body {\n  margin-top: $spacing-06;\n  flex-grow: 1; // fill space so icons are bottom aligned\n  @include type-style('body-long-01');\n\n  // prevent large line lengths between small and medium viewports\n  @include breakpoint-between(321px, md) {\n    max-width: 75%;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Check accessibility\n\nWe've added new markup and styles, so it's a good practice to check\n[Equal Access Checker](https://www.ibm.com/able/toolkit/tools/) and make sure\nour rendered markup is on the right track for accessibility.\n\nWith the browser extension installed, Chrome in this example, open Dev Tools and\nrun Accessibility Assessment.\n\n## Submit pull request\n\nWe're going to submit a pull request to verify completion of this tutorial step.\n\n### Continuous integration (CI) check\n\nRun the CI check to make sure we're all set to submit a pull request.\n\n```bash\nyarn ci-check\n```\n\n<InlineNotification>\n\n**Note:** Having issues running the CI check?\n[Step 1](</developing/react-tutorial/step-1#continuous-integration-(ci)-check>)\nhas troubleshooting notes that may help.\n\n</InlineNotification>\n\n### Git commit and push\n\nBefore we can create a pull request, format your code, then stage and commit all\nof your changes:\n\n```bash\nyarn format\ngit add --all && git commit -m \"feat(tutorial): complete step 4\"\n```\n\nThen, push to your repository:\n\n```bash\ngit push origin v11-react-step-4\n```\n\n<InlineNotification>\n\n**Note:** Having issues pushing your changes?\n[Step 1](/developing/react-tutorial/step-1#git-commit-and-push) has\ntroubleshooting notes that may help.\n\n</InlineNotification>\n\n### Pull request (PR)\n\nFinally, visit\n[carbon-tutorial](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-tutorial) to\n\"Compare & pull request\".
