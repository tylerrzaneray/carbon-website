If you want to jump straight to code, you may want to skip this\ntutorial and go to the [developers getting started](/developing/get-started)\npage.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n### React\n\nThis is a web development tutorial that uses the Carbon React components. If\nyou're just getting started with React and enjoy learning-by-doing, check out\nthe official React [intro tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html).\nYou'll want to supplement that with their\n[step-by-step guide](https://reactjs.org/docs/hello-world.html).\n\n### ES6/ES2015\n\nReact apps often use the latest and greatest from JavaScript (ES6/ES2015).\nYou'll want to be up to speed on the most commonly used features of the\nlanguage.\n[Let's Learn ES6](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL57atfCFqj2h5fpdZD-doGEIs0NZxeJTX)\ncovers those features in depth.\n\n### GitHub\n\nWe'll be using GitHub to build an app together, so if you're new to GitHub, make\nsure you've [made an account](https://github.com/join). Their\n[getting started guide](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world) is a\ngreat way to learn GitHub.\n\n### Yarn\n\nThis tutorial uses [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) for dependency management so we\ncan take advantage of offline installs. Make sure that you have\n[Yarn installed](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) prior to starting the\ntutorial so you can follow along step-by-step.\n\n## Outline\n\nEach step in this tutorial illustrates a different aspect of developing web\napplications with Carbon. We recommend starting with step 1, but you can pick up\nany step and take it from there.\n\n1. [**Installing Carbon**](/developing/react-tutorial/step-1)\n   - Create a web app with the UI shell component.\n2. [**Building pages**](/developing/react-tutorial/step-2)\n   - Build out pages with the grid and various components.\n3. [**Using APIs**](/developing/react-tutorial/step-3)\n   - Populate the data table with an external data source.\n4. [**Creating components**](/developing/react-tutorial/step-4)\n   - Extend Carbon by creating your own components.\n5. [**Deploying to IBM Cloud**](/developing/react-tutorial/step-5)\n   - Build and host your app in a production environment.\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"92921dfeaca2b4c2ec0c90ab2199d6fd","owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx","counter":4041},"frontmatter":{"title":"Tutorial overview","description":"Welcome to Carbon!
