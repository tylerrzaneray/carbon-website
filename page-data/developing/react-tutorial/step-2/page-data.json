If you haven't forked and cloned\nthat repository yet, and haven't added the upstream remote, go ahead and do so\nby following the\n[step 1 instructions](/developing/react-tutorial/step-1#fork-clone-and-branch).\n\n### Branch\n\nWith your repository all set up, let's check out the branch for this tutorial\nstep's starting point.\n\n```bash\ngit fetch upstream\ngit checkout -b v11-react-step-2 upstream/v11-react-step-2\n```\n\n<InlineNotification>\n\n**Note:** This builds on top of step 1, but be sure to check out the upstream\nstep 2 branch because it includes the static assets required to get through this\nstep.\n\n</InlineNotification>\n\n### Build and start app\n\nInstall the app's dependencies (in case you're starting fresh in your current\ndirectory and not continuing from the previous step):\n\n```bash\nyarn\n```\n\nThen, start the app:\n\n```bash\nyarn start\n```\n\nYou should see something similar to where the\n[previous step](/developing/react-tutorial/step-1) left off.\n\n### IE11 polyfills\n\nBefore we get started with this step, we'll be adding some components that\nrequire IE11 polyfills. As shown in the\n[Carbon React documentation](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/blob/v10/packages/react/.storybook/polyfills.js),\ngo ahead and add these imports to the top of the root `index.js`. They aren't\nall needed, but we'll add them all to play it safe for the duration of the\ntutorial.\n\n```javascript path=src/index.js\nimport 'core-js/modules/es7.array.includes';\nimport 'core-js/modules/es6.array.fill';\nimport 'core-js/modules/es6.string.includes';\nimport 'core-js/modules/es6.string.trim';\nimport 'core-js/modules/es7.object.values';\n```\n\n<InlineNotification>\n\n**Note:** You may be wondering where `core-js`came from because it's not a\nCarbon package and we haven't explicitly installed it. Run `yarn why core-js`\nand you'll see there are a number of packages that have brought it in as a\ndependency.\n\n</InlineNotification>\n\n## Add landing page grid\n\nLet's add our grid elements to `LandingPage.js`.\n\nIn order to use the grid, we need to wrap everything in a `<Grid>`. Because\nwe're building with the new CSS Grid, we won't be using typical rows. We'll use\na combination of `<Column>` and nested subgrids to create our layout.\n\nThe CSS Grid is a 16 column grid. We will specify the span of a `<Column>` using\nthe `sm`, `md`, and `lg` props. For example, `<Column sm={2} md={8} lg={8}/>`\nmeans the column will span 2/4 columns at the small breakpoint, 8/8 columns at\nthe medium breakpoint, 8/16 columns at the large breakpoint.\n\nWe've included the designs for this tutorial app in the `design.sketch` file\nfound as a top-level file in the `carbon-tutorial` repository. But, if you don't\nhave Sketch installed and available to inspect the design, we'll provide\nscreenshots.\n\n![Landing page grid](../shared/step-2/images/landing-layout.png)\n\n<Caption>Landing page grid</Caption>\n\n<InlineNotification>\n\n**Pro tip:** `CTRL-L` toggles the layout in Sketch.\n\n</InlineNotification>\n\nFirst, we need to import our grid components at the top of `LandingPage.js`:\n\n```javascript path=src/content/LandingPage/LandingPage.js\nimport { Grid, Column } from '@carbon/react';\n```\n\nWe'll break this down into three rows. The first row with the gray background\ndoesn't appear to need any columns. The second row with the white background\nlooks like it has two columns of different widths. The third row with the gray\nbackground looks like it has four columns of equal width.\n\nWe'll make rows like so:\n\n```jsx path=src/content/LandingPage/LandingPage.js\nreturn (\n  <Grid className=\"landing-page\" fullWidth>\n    <Column lg={16} md={8} sm={4} className=\"landing-page__banner\">\n      1\n    </Column>\n    <Column lg={16} md={8} sm={4} className=\"landing-page__r2\">\n      <Grid className=\"tabs-group-content\">\n        <Column md={4} lg={7} sm={4} className=\"landing-page__tab-content\">\n          7/16\n        </Column>\n        <Column md={4} lg={{ span: 8, offset: 7 }} sm={4}>\n          8/16\n        </Column>\n      </Grid>\n    </Column>\n    <Column lg={16} md={8} sm={4} className=\"landing-page__r3\">\n      <Grid>\n        <Column md={4} lg={4} sm={4}>\n          1/4\n        </Column>\n        <Column md={4} lg={4} sm={4}>\n          1/4\n        </Column>\n        <Column md={4} lg={4} sm={4}>\n          1/4\n        </Column>\n        <Column md={4} lg={4} sm={4}>\n          1/4\n        </Column>\n      </Grid>\n    </Column>\n  </Grid>\n);\n```\n\nWe added a prop of `fullWidth` to the main grid container since our rows need to\nexpand the whole page without any margins. We also added some custom classes\nlike `landing-page`, `landing-page__banner`, `landing-page__r2`, etc., which we\nwill use later.\n\n## Build landing page\n\nWe'll start adding HTML elements and components by row.\n\n### First row\n\nIn our first row we'll need a `Breadcrumb` component. First, let's import the\ncomponents we need. Because we'll be importing several components for this page,\nwe'll import them directly from the `@carbon/react` package instead of the\ndirect path for each one.\n\n```javascript path=src/content/LandingPage/LandingPage.js\nimport { Breadcrumb, BreadcrumbItem, Grid, Column } from '@carbon/react';\n```\n\nWe can now add our component to the first row, along with a header, like so:\n\n```jsx path=src/content/LandingPage/LandingPage.js\n<Column lg={16} md={8} sm={4} className=\"landing-page__banner\">\n  <Breadcrumb noTrailingSlash>\n    <BreadcrumbItem>\n      <a href=\"/\">Getting started</a>\n    </BreadcrumbItem>\n  </Breadcrumb>\n  <h1 className=\"landing-page__heading\">Design &amp; build with Carbon</h1>\n</Column>\n```\n\nYou may notice that the styles look off. Don't worry, we'll fix these later.\n\n### Second row\n\nIn our second row we'll need `Tabs` and `Button` components. We'll update the\n`@carbon/react` import to:\n\n```javascript path=src/content/LandingPage/LandingPage.js\nimport {\n  Breadcrumb,\n  BreadcrumbItem,\n  Button,\n  Tabs,\n  Tab,\n  TabList,\n  TabPanels,\n  TabPanel,\n  Grid,\n  Column,\n} from '@carbon/react';\n```\n\nModify the second row to use the `Tabs` components.\n\n<InlineNotification>\n\n**Note:** We're using the grid for the page layout, but we also need to apply\nthe grid within the tab content. When doing so, make sure the nested grid has\nthe expected `Grid` > `Column` DOM structure. Nested grids are officially\nsupported with our CSS Grid. If you are using `FlexGrid`, subgrid is not\nsupported.\n\n</InlineNotification>\n\n```jsx path=src/content/LandingPage/LandingPage.js\n<Column lg={16} md={8} sm={4} className=\"landing-page__r2\">\n  <Tabs defaultSelectedIndex={0}>\n    <TabList className=\"tabs-group\">\n      <Tab>About</Tab>\n      <Tab>Design</Tab>\n      <Tab>Develop</Tab>\n    </TabList>\n    <TabPanels>\n      <TabPanel>\n        <Grid className=\"tabs-group-content\">\n          <Column md={4} lg={7} sm={4} className=\"landing-page__tab-content\">\n            <h2 className=\"landing-page__subheading\">What is Carbon?</h2>\n            <p className=\"landing-page__p\">\n              Carbon is IBM’s open-source design system for digital products and\n              experiences. With the IBM Design Language as its foundation, the\n              system consists of working code, design tools and resources, human\n              interface guidelines, and a vibrant community of contributors.\n            </p>\n            <Button>Learn more</Button>\n          </Column>\n          <Column md={4} lg={{ span: 8, offset: 7 }} sm={4}>\n            IMAGE WILL GO HERE\n          </Column>\n        </Grid>\n      </TabPanel>\n      <TabPanel>\n        <Grid className=\"tabs-group-content\">\n          <Column lg={16} md={8} sm={4} className=\"landing-page__tab-content\">\n            Rapidly build beautiful and accessible experiences. The Carbon kit\n            contains all resources you need to get started.\n          </Column>\n        </Grid>\n      </TabPanel>\n      <TabPanel>\n        <Grid className=\"tabs-group-content\">\n          <Column lg={16} md={8} sm={4} className=\"landing-page__tab-content\">\n            Carbon provides styles and components in Vanilla, React, Angular,\n            and Vue for anyone building on the web.\n          </Column>\n        </Grid>\n      </TabPanel>\n    </TabPanels>\n  </Tabs>\n</Column>\n```\n\nThe `<TabList>` is the tab navigation, and the `<TabPanels>` contains each tab\ncontent. You'll notice that within each `<TabPanel>`, we nested another `<Grid>`\nand `<Column>`. This is because the parent column\n`<Column lg={16} md={8} sm={4} className=\"landing-page__r2\">` is acting as a\nfaux row, and each tab within that row contains the actual column content. When\nnesting columns, you must always wrap the nested group within another `<Grid>`.\n\nHold up! If you were to run the\n[Equal Access Toolkit](https://www.ibm.com/able/toolkit) to check for\naccessibility violations, you'd see\n`Multiple navigation landmarks must have unique labels specified with aria-label or aria-labelledby`\nbecause both the `Breadcrumb` and `Tabs` components use `<nav>` elements. To\nfix, add `aria-label` to the `Breadcrumb` opening tag:\n\n```jsx\n<Breadcrumb noTrailingSlash aria-label=\"Page navigation\">\n```\n\nSame goes for the `TabList` opening tag:\n\n```jsx\n<TabList className=\"tabs-group\" aria-label=\"Tab navigation\">\n```\n\nNext, we'll need to add some styling overrides to move the tabs to the right on\nlarge viewports. Create a file `_overrides.scss` in `src/content/LandingPage`\nwith this declaration block.\n\n```scss path=src/content/LandingPage/_overrides.scss\n.landing-page__r2 .cds--tabs--scrollable {\n  transform: translateZ(0);\n  justify-content: flex-end;\n}\n\n.landing-page__r2 .cds--tab-content {\n  padding: 0;\n}\n\n.cds--tab--list {\n  justify-content: flex-end;\n  padding-right: 1rem;\n}\n\n.cds--subgrid--wide {\n  //fix needed to keep the subgrid from scrolling horizontally\n  margin-right: 1rem;\n}\n```\n\nThen in `_landing-page.scss` add this import at the top of the file.\n\n```scss path=src/content/LandingPage/_landing-page.scss\n@use './overrides.scss';\n```\n\n<InlineNotification>\n\n**Note:** We don't have to include this in a separate file, but it's nice to\nkeep overrides separate from your application's styling so when migrating to\nfuture Carbon versions and if there are breaking changes via different class\nnames, you have a consolidated list of styling declaration blocks to review.\n\n</InlineNotification>\n\nWe can now add our images and text for each column in the first `Tab` in\n`LandingPage.js`.\n\n```jsx path=src/content/LandingPage/LandingPage.js\n<Column md={4} lg={{ span: 8, offset: 7 }} sm={4}>\n  <img\n    className=\"landing-page__illo\"\n    src={`${process.env.PUBLIC_URL}/tab-illo.png`}\n    alt=\"Carbon illustration\"\n  />\n</Column>\n```\n\nNow let's set the image size in `_landing-page.scss`:\n\n```scss path=src/content/LandingPage/_landing-page.scss\n.landing-page__illo {\n  max-width: 100%;\n}\n```\n\nAssuming that the second and third tab would have a similar design, we would set\nthem up in the same way. However, since our design specs don't show those tabs,\nwe'll leave the code as is.\n\n### Third row\n\nThe third row will be created in a later tutorial, so we'll just add the headers\nfor now.\n\n```jsx path=src/content/LandingPage/LandingPage.js\n<Column lg={16} md={8} sm={4} className=\"landing-page__r3\">\n  <Grid>\n    <Column md={4} lg={4} sm={4}>\n      <h3 className=\"landing-page__label\">The Principles</h3>\n    </Column>\n    <Column md={4} lg={4} sm={4}>\n      Carbon is Open\n    </Column>\n    <Column md={4} lg={4} sm={4}>\n      Carbon is Modular\n    </Column>\n    <Column md={4} lg={4} sm={4}>\n      Carbon is Consistent\n    </Column>\n  </Grid>\n</Column>\n```\n\n## Style landing page\n\nWe've added basic layout styles in `_landing-page.scss`, so now let's add type,\ncolor, and spacing styles to match the design. We'll be using our\n[spacing tokens](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/guidelines/spacing/overview).\nIn `_landing-page.scss`, add these imports at the **top** of the file (above our\noverrides import) so we can use Carbon breakpoints, tokens, and typography Sass\nmixins and functions:\n\n```scss path=src/content/LandingPage/_landing-page.scss\n@use '@carbon/react/scss/spacing' as *;\n@use '@carbon/react/scss/type' as *;\n@use '@carbon/react/scss/breakpoint' as *;\n@use '@carbon/react/scss/theme' as *;\n```\n\n### Banner\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Banner vertical spacing](../shared/step-2/images/landing-r1-spacing.png)\n\n<Caption>Banner vertical spacing</Caption>\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n<InlineNotification>\n\n**Pro tip:** `CTRL-G` toggles the grid in Sketch.\n\n</InlineNotification>\n\nBack to `_landing-page.scss`, we need to add space above the breadcrumb and\nbelow the heading. For that, add:\n\n```scss path=src/content/LandingPage/_landing-page.scss\n.landing-page__banner {\n  padding-top: $spacing-05;\n  padding-bottom: $spacing-07 * 4;\n  padding-left: $spacing-06;\n}\n```\n\nReferencing the\n[spacing token table](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/guidelines/spacing/overview#spacing-scale),\n`16px` can be set with the `$spacing-05` token. The design calls for `128px` of\nspace below the heading and that's not in the spacing scale. We can achieve this\nin Sass by multiplying 32px (`$spacing-07`) by 4. We could use `128px` or `8rem`\ndirectly in our styling, but using our tokens preserves consistency should the\ntoken values get updated in the future.\n\nLooking at the design, we need a wall-to-wall light gray background behind the\nbanner and also behind the third row. This is a great opportunity to use a Sass\nmixin. We could put this at the top of `_landing-page.scss`, but it's best\npractice to place mixins in a dedicated file, so create a `_mixins.scss` file in\n`src/content/LandingPage`.\n\nAdd the following in `_mixins.scss`. Per the design we need to use Gray 10 for\nour banner background color, which can be set with the `$layer-01`\n[color token](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/guidelines/color/usage). Also,\nwe want the background to extend into the grid's outermost gutters to go the\nfull width of the viewport, so given the DOM structure, we can achieve that by\nsetting the background in an absolutely positioned pseudo element.\n\n```scss path=src/content/LandingPage/_mixins.scss\n@use '@carbon/react/scss/spacing' as *;\n@use '@carbon/react/scss/theme' as *;\n\n@mixin landing-page-background() {\n  background-color: $layer-01;\n  position: relative;\n}\n```\n\nAfter you have created `_mixins.scss`, import it at the **top** of\n`_landing-page.scss`. By now you should have six imports:\n\n```scss path=src/content/LandingPage/_landing-page.scss\n@use '@carbon/react/scss/spacing' as *;\n@use '@carbon/react/scss/type' as *;\n@use '@carbon/react/scss/breakpoint' as *;\n@use '@carbon/react/scss/theme' as *;\n@use './mixins.scss' as *;\n@use './overrides.scss';\n```\n\nNow to use the new mixin, update the `.landing-page__banner` declaration block\nto:\n\n```scss path=src/content/LandingPage/_landing-page.scss\n.landing-page__banner {\n  padding-top: $spacing-05;\n  padding-bottom: $spacing-07 * 4;\n  padding-left: $spacing-06;\n  @include landing-page-background;\n}\n```\n\nNext, we can see that the `h1` is using the `heading-05` type token.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Banner heading type](../shared/step-2/images/landing-r1-type.png)\n\n<Caption>Banner heading type</Caption>\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\nThe Sketch symbol naming is consistent with the development Sass tokens to help\ntranslate design to development. So, looking up the\n[type token](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/guidelines/typography/productive),\nwe know to use `productive-heading-05`:\n\n```scss path=src/content/LandingPage/_landing-page.scss\n.landing-page__heading {\n  @include type-style('productive-heading-05');\n}\n```\n\n### Row two\n\nFor our second row, we need to fix the tabs vertical positioning to match the\ndesign. By inspecting the tabs component, you can see that the tab height\ncomputes to `40px`. We can use that to create our negative top margin in rem\nunits.\n\n```scss path=src/content/LandingPage/_landing-page.scss\n.landing-page__r2 {\n  margin-top: rem(-40px);\n}\n```\n\nWe also need to adjust our vertical spacing and type treatment. Like before,\nit's a matter of using spacing and type tokens like so:\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Row 2 vertical spacing](../shared/step-2/images/landing-r2-spacing.png)\n\n<Caption>Row 2 vertical spacing</Caption>\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n<InlineNotification>\n\n**Note:** You may be wondering why there are vertical gaps between the type and\nspacers. Each type token has a line height that's suited for its font size. The\nvertical spacers adjacently touch the line height boundaries and not the\nbaseline, for consistency as well as development ease so `margins` and\n`paddings` don't need to offset line heights.\n\n</InlineNotification>\n\n```scss path=src/content/LandingPage/_landing-page.scss\n.tabs-group-content {\n  padding: $spacing-10 $spacing-06;\n}\n\n.landing-page__subheading {\n  @include type-style('productive-heading-03');\n\n  font-weight: 600;\n}\n\n.landing-page__p {\n  @include type-style('productive-heading-03');\n  margin-top: $spacing-06;\n  margin-bottom: $spacing-08;\n\n  @include breakpoint-between((320px + 1), md) {\n    max-width: 75%;\n  }\n}\n\n.tabs-group {\n  background-color: $layer-01;\n}\n```\n\n### Row three\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Row 3 vertical spacing](../shared/step-2/images/landing-r3-spacing.png)\n\n<Caption>Row 3 vertical spacing</Caption>\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\nLet's also add some styles for the last row, even though that will get used\nlater in the tutorial. You'll notice that we get to re-use the\n`landing-page-background` mixin that we just created.\n\n```scss path=src/content/LandingPage/_landing-page.scss\n.landing-page__r3 {\n  padding-top: $spacing-09;\n  padding-bottom: $spacing-09;\n  padding-left: $spacing-06;\n  @include landing-page-background;\n}\n\n.landing-page__label {\n  @include type-style('heading-01');\n}\n```\n\nLastly, we'll fix some grid alignment issues. We'll use one of our breakpoint\nmixins for the media queries, like so:\n\n```scss path=src/content/LandingPage/_landing-page.scss\n.landing-page__banner,\n.landing-page__r2,\n.landing-page__r3 {\n  margin-left: -20px;\n  margin-right: -20px;\n\n  @include breakpoint-down(md) {\n    margin-left: 0;\n    margin-right: 0;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nWe are almost done with the landing page. You may notice a few styles are off.\nTo fix this, we'll update some of the overriding styles in `index.scss`. We\nalready have some overriding styles for `.cds--content`. We need to add\n`padding: 0;` to this selector and add one more selector for the grid below\nthat:\n\n```scss path=src/index.scss\n.cds--content {\n  margin-top: 3rem;\n  padding: 0;\n  background: var(--cds-background);\n}\n\n.cds--content .cds--css-grid {\n  max-width: 100%;\n  @include breakpoint(md) {\n    padding-left: 20px;\n    padding-right: 20px;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nSince we are using out `breakpoint` mixin, we need to import the styles for that\nbelow our Carbon styles import:\n\n```scss path=src/index.scss\n@use '@carbon/react';\n@use '@carbon/react/scss/breakpoint' as *;\n```\n\nTa-da! You should see a finished landing page! Now we can move on to the repo\npage.\n\n## Add repo page grid\n\nNow in our `RepoPage.js` we'll import our `Grid` components at the top:\n\n```javascript path=src/content/RepoPage/RepoPage.js\nimport { Grid, Column } from '@carbon/react';\n```\n\nThen add our grid containers in the `return` section.\n\n```javascript path=src/content/RepoPage/RepoPage.js\nreturn (\n  <Grid className=\"repo-page\">\n    <Column lg={16} className=\"repo-page__r1\">\n      Data table will go here\n    </Column>\n  </Grid>\n);\n```\n\n## Build repo page\n\nWe currently have `RepoPage.js` that just contains a grid and placeholder\ncontent for the time being. In the next tutorial step we're going to be querying\nan API to populate the `DataTable` component in this page. As a best practice to\nseparate data fetching from the presentation components, go ahead and create a\n`RepoTable.js` as a sibling to `RepoPage.js` in `src/content/RepoPage`.\n\n### Build data table\n\nFirst, we'll add our data table by importing a few components in `RepoTable.js`:\n\n```javascript path=src/content/RepoPage/RepoTable.js\nimport React from 'react';\nimport {\n  DataTable,\n  TableContainer,\n  Table,\n  TableHead,\n  TableRow,\n  TableExpandHeader,\n  TableHeader,\n  TableBody,\n  TableExpandRow,\n  TableCell,\n  TableExpandedRow,\n} from '@carbon/react';\n```\n\nThen, let's create the `RepoTable` component and export it at the very bottom of\n`RepoTable.js`.\n\n```javascript path=src/content/RepoPage/RepoTable.js\nconst RepoTable = ({ rows, headers }) => {\n  return (\n    <DataTable\n      rows={rows}\n      headers={headers}\n      render={({\n        rows,\n        headers,\n        getHeaderProps,\n        getRowProps,\n        getTableProps,\n      }) => (\n        <TableContainer\n          title=\"Carbon Repositories\"\n          description=\"A collection of public Carbon repositories.\"\n        >\n          <Table {...getTableProps()}>\n            <TableHead>\n              <TableRow>\n                <TableExpandHeader />\n                {headers.map((header) => (\n                  <TableHeader {...getHeaderProps({ header })}>\n                    {header.header}\n                  </TableHeader>\n                ))}\n              </TableRow>\n            </TableHead>\n            <TableBody>\n              {rows.map((row) => (\n                <React.Fragment key={row.id}>\n                  <TableExpandRow {...getRowProps({ row })}>\n                    {row.cells.map((cell) => (\n                      <TableCell key={cell.id}>{cell.value}</TableCell>\n                    ))}\n                  </TableExpandRow>\n                  <TableExpandedRow colSpan={headers.length + 1}>\n                    <p>Row description</p>\n                  </TableExpandedRow>\n                </React.Fragment>\n              ))}\n            </TableBody>\n          </Table>\n        </TableContainer>\n      )}\n    />\n  );\n};\n\nexport default RepoTable;\n```\n\nThis component uses two props, `rows` and `headers`, and returns a Carbon\n`DataTable`. As for where the various `Table*` components came from? The\n[DataTable story](https://react.carbondesignsystem.com/?path=/story/components-datatable-expansion--usage)\nin Storybook was used to put together the data table structure.\n\n<InlineNotification>\n\n**Note:** The `getTableProps`, `getHeaderProps`, and `getRowProps` functions\neach tell the `DataTable` component to process and return the necessary props\nthat are needed by the `Table`, `TableHeader` and `TableRow` components\nrespectively. We take the return of that function (an object containing the\nprops) and\n[spread it out](https://reactjs.org/docs/jsx-in-depth.html#spread-attributes)\ninto the component.\n\n</InlineNotification>\n\nAt this point, return to `RepoPage.js` because now we need to render a static\n`RepoTable`.\n\n### Render data table\n\nImport `RepoTable` in `RepoPage.js`.\n\n```javascript path=src/content/RepoPage/RepoPage.js\nimport React from 'react';\nimport RepoTable from './RepoTable';\nimport { Grid, Column } from '@carbon/react';\n```\n\nThen below the imports, include the following arrays to pass into the\n`RepoTable` component. We'll be setting the `rows` array from an API in the next\ntutorial step, but for now, static example rows will suffice.\n\n```javascript path=src/content/RepoPage/RepoPage.js\nconst headers = [\n  {\n    key: 'name',\n    header: 'Name',\n  },\n  {\n    key: 'createdAt',\n    header: 'Created',\n  },\n  {\n    key: 'updatedAt',\n    header: 'Updated',\n  },\n  {\n    key: 'issueCount',\n    header: 'Open Issues',\n  },\n  {\n    key: 'stars',\n    header: 'Stars',\n  },\n  {\n    key: 'links',\n    header: 'Links',\n  },\n];\n\nconst rows = [\n  {\n    id: '1',\n    name: 'Repo 1',\n    createdAt: 'Date',\n    updatedAt: 'Date',\n    issueCount: '123',\n    stars: '456',\n    links: 'Links',\n  },\n  {\n    id: '2',\n    name: 'Repo 2',\n    createdAt: 'Date',\n    updatedAt: 'Date',\n    issueCount: '123',\n    stars: '456',\n    links: 'Links',\n  },\n  {\n    id: '3',\n    name: 'Repo 3',\n    createdAt: 'Date',\n    updatedAt: 'Date',\n    issueCount: '123',\n    stars: '456',\n    links: 'Links',\n  },\n];\n```\n\nLastly in `RepoPage.js`, we need to simply replace `Data table will go here`\nwith:\n\n```jsx path=src/content/RepoPage/RepoPage.js\n<RepoTable headers={headers} rows={rows} />\n```\n\n## Style repo page\n\nOur styles for the repo page are mostly fine. We just need to update a few\nvertical spacing issues.\n\nIn `_repo-page.scss`, add the following styles:\n\n```scss path=src/content/RepoPage/_repo-page.scss\n@use '@carbon/react/scss/spacing' as *;\n\n.repo-page__r1 {\n  padding-top: $spacing-05;\n  padding-bottom: $spacing-05;\n}\n```\n\nCongratulations! We've now created our static repo page!\n\n## Submit pull request\n\nWe're going to submit a pull request to verify completion of this tutorial step.\n\n### Continuous integration (CI) check\n\nRun the CI check to make sure we're all set to submit a pull request.\n\n```bash\nyarn ci-check\n```\n\n<InlineNotification>\n\n**Note:** Having issues running the CI check?\n[Step 1](</developing/react-tutorial/step-1#continuous-integration-(ci)-check>)\nhas troubleshooting notes that may help.\n\n</InlineNotification>\n\n### Git commit and push\n\nBefore we can create a pull request, format your code, then stage and commit all\nof your changes:\n\n```bash\nyarn format\ngit add --all && git commit -m \"feat(tutorial): complete step 2\"\n```\n\nThen, push to your repository:\n\n```bash\ngit push origin v11-react-step-2\n```\n\n<InlineNotification>\n\n**Note:** Having issues pushing your changes?\n[Step 1](/developing/react-tutorial/step-1#git-commit-and-push) has\ntroubleshooting notes that may help.\n\n</InlineNotification>\n\n### Pull request (PR)\n\nFinally, visit\n[carbon-tutorial](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-tutorial) to\n\"Compare & pull request\". In doing so, make sure that you are comparing to\n`v11-react-step-2` into `base: v11-react-step-2`.\n\n<InlineNotification>\n\n**Note:** Expect your tutorial step PRs to be reviewed by the Carbon team but\nnot merged.

If you haven't forked and cloned\nthat repository yet, and haven't added the upstream remote, go ahead and do so\nby following the\n[step 1 instructions](/developing/react-tutorial/step-1#fork-clone-and-branch).\n\n### Branch\n\nWith your repository all set up, let's check out the branch for this tutorial\nstep's starting point.\n\n```bash\ngit fetch upstream\ngit checkout -b v11-react-step-2 upstream/v11-react-step-2\n```\n\n<InlineNotification>\n\n**Note:** This builds on top of step 1, but be sure to check out the upstream\nstep 2 branch because it includes the static assets required to get through this\nstep.\n\n</InlineNotification>\n\n### Build and start app\n\nInstall the app's dependencies (in case you're starting fresh in your current\ndirectory and not continuing from the previous step):\n\n```bash\nyarn\n```\n\nThen, start the app:\n\n```bash\nyarn start\n```\n\nYou should see something similar to where the\n[previous step](/developing/react-tutorial/step-1) left off.\n\n### IE11 polyfills\n\nBefore we get started with this step, we'll be adding some components that\nrequire IE11 polyfills. As shown in the\n[Carbon React documentation](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon/blob/v10/packages/react/.storybook/polyfills.js),\ngo ahead and add these imports to the top of the root `index.js`. They aren't\nall needed, but we'll add them all to play it safe for the duration of the\ntutorial.\n\n```javascript path=src/index.js\nimport 'core-js/modules/es7.array.includes';\nimport 'core-js/modules/es6.array.fill';\nimport 'core-js/modules/es6.string.includes';\nimport 'core-js/modules/es6.string.trim';\nimport 'core-js/modules/es7.object.values';\n```\n\n<InlineNotification>\n\n**Note:** You may be wondering where `core-js`came from because it's not a\nCarbon package and we haven't explicitly installed it. Run `yarn why core-js`\nand you'll see there are a number of packages that have brought it in as a\ndependency.\n\n</InlineNotification>\n\n## Add landing page grid\n\nLet's add our grid elements to `LandingPage.js`.\n\nIn order to use the grid, we need to wrap everything in a `<Grid>`. Because\nwe're building with the new CSS Grid, we won't be using typical rows. We'll use\na combination of `<Column>` and nested subgrids to create our layout.\n\nThe CSS Grid is a 16 column grid. We will specify the span of a `<Column>` using\nthe `sm`, `md`, and `lg` props. For example, `<Column sm={2} md={8} lg={8}/>`\nmeans the column will span 2/4 columns at the small breakpoint, 8/8 columns at\nthe medium breakpoint, 8/16 columns at the large breakpoint.\n\nWe've included the designs for this tutorial app in the `design.sketch` file\nfound as a top-level file in the `carbon-tutorial` repository. But, if you don't\nhave Sketch installed and available to inspect the design, we'll provide\nscreenshots.\n\n![Landing page grid](../shared/step-2/images/landing-layout.png)\n\n<Caption>Landing page grid</Caption>\n\n<InlineNotification>\n\n**Pro tip:** `CTRL-L` toggles the layout in Sketch.\n\n</InlineNotification>\n\nFirst, we need to import our grid components at the top of `LandingPage.js`:\n\n```javascript path=src/content/LandingPage/LandingPage.js\nimport { Grid, Column } from '@carbon/react';\n```\n\nWe'll break this down into three rows. The first row with the gray background\ndoesn't appear to need any columns. The second row with the white background\nlooks like it has two columns of different widths. The third row with the gray\nbackground looks like it has four columns of equal width.\n\nWe'll make rows like so:\n\n```jsx path=src/content/LandingPage/LandingPage.js\nreturn (\n  <Grid className=\"landing-page\" fullWidth>\n    <Column lg={16} md={8} sm={4} className=\"landing-page__banner\">\n      1\n    </Column>\n    <Column lg={16} md={8} sm={4} className=\"landing-page__r2\">\n      <Grid className=\"tabs-group-content\">\n        <Column md={4} lg={7} sm={4} className=\"landing-page__tab-content\">\n          7/16\n        </Column>\n        <Column md={4} lg={{ span: 8, offset: 7 }} sm={4}>\n          8/16\n        </Column>\n      </Grid>\n    </Column>\n    <Column lg={16} md={8} sm={4} className=\"landing-page__r3\">\n      <Grid>\n        <Column md={4} lg={4} sm={4}>\n          1/4\n        </Column>\n        <Column md={4} lg={4} sm={4}>\n          1/4\n        </Column>\n        <Column md={4} lg={4} sm={4}>\n          1/4\n        </Column>\n        <Column md={4} lg={4} sm={4}>\n          1/4\n        </Column>\n      </Grid>\n    </Column>\n  </Grid>\n);\n```\n\nWe added a prop of `fullWidth` to the main grid container since our rows need to\nexpand the whole page without any margins. We also added some custom classes\nlike `landing-page`, `landing-page__banner`, `landing-page__r2`, etc., which we\nwill use later.\n\n## Build landing page\n\nWe'll start adding HTML elements and components by row.\n\n### First row\n\nIn our first row we'll need a `Breadcrumb` component. First, let's import the\ncomponents we need. Because we'll be importing several components for this page,\nwe'll import them directly from the `@carbon/react` package instead of the\ndirect path for each one.\n\n```javascript path=src/content/LandingPage/LandingPage.js\nimport { Breadcrumb, BreadcrumbItem, Grid, Column } from '@carbon/react';\n```\n\nWe can now add our component to the first row, along with a header, like so:\n\n```jsx path=src/content/LandingPage/LandingPage.js\n<Column lg={16} md={8} sm={4} className=\"landing-page__banner\">\n  <Breadcrumb noTrailingSlash>\n    <BreadcrumbItem>\n      <a href=\"/\">Getting started</a>\n    </BreadcrumbItem>\n  </Breadcrumb>\n  <h1 className=\"landing-page__heading\">Design &amp; build with Carbon</h1>\n</Column>\n```\n\nYou may notice that the styles look off. Don't worry, we'll fix these later.\n\n### Second row\n\nIn our second row we'll need `Tabs` and `Button` components. We'll update the\n`@carbon/react` import to:\n\n```javascript path=src/content/LandingPage/LandingPage.js\nimport {\n  Breadcrumb,\n  BreadcrumbItem,\n  Button,\n  Tabs,\n  Tab,\n  TabList,\n  TabPanels,\n  TabPanel,\n  Grid,\n  Column,\n} from '@carbon/react';\n```\n\nModify the second row to use the `Tabs` components.\n\n<InlineNotification>\n\n**Note:** We're using the grid for the page layout, but we also need to apply\nthe grid within the tab content. When doing so, make sure the nested grid has\nthe expected `Grid` > `Column` DOM structure. Nested grids are officially\nsupported with our CSS Grid. If you are using `FlexGrid`, subgrid is not\nsupported.\n\n</InlineNotification>\n\n```jsx path=src/content/LandingPage/LandingPage.js\n<Column lg={16} md={8} sm={4} className=\"landing-page__r2\">\n  <Tabs defaultSelectedIndex={0}>\n    <TabList className=\"tabs-group\">\n      <Tab>About</Tab>\n      <Tab>Design</Tab>\n      <Tab>Develop</Tab>\n    </TabList>\n    <TabPanels>\n      <TabPanel>\n        <Grid className=\"tabs-group-content\">\n          <Column md={4} lg={7} sm={4} className=\"landing-page__tab-content\">\n            <h2 className=\"landing-page__subheading\">What is Carbon?</h2>\n            <p className=\"landing-page__p\">\n              Carbon is IBM’s open-source design system for digital products and\n              experiences. With the IBM Design Language as its foundation, the\n              system consists of working code, design tools and resources, human\n              interface guidelines, and a vibrant community of contributors.\n            </p>\n            <Button>Learn more</Button>\n          </Column>\n          <Column md={4} lg={{ span: 8, offset: 7 }} sm={4}>\n            IMAGE WILL GO HERE\n          </Column>\n        </Grid>\n      </TabPanel>\n      <TabPanel>\n        <Grid className=\"tabs-group-content\">\n          <Column lg={16} md={8} sm={4} className=\"landing-page__tab-content\">\n            Rapidly build beautiful and accessible experiences. The Carbon kit\n            contains all resources you need to get started.\n          </Column>\n        </Grid>\n      </TabPanel>\n      <TabPanel>\n        <Grid className=\"tabs-group-content\">\n          <Column lg={16} md={8} sm={4} className=\"landing-page__tab-content\">\n            Carbon provides styles and components in Vanilla, React, Angular,\n            and Vue for anyone building on the web.\n          </Column>\n        </Grid>\n      </TabPanel>\n    </TabPanels>\n  </Tabs>\n</Column>\n```\n\nThe `<TabList>` is the tab navigation, and the `<TabPanels>` contains each tab\ncontent. You'll notice that within each `<TabPanel>`, we nested another `<Grid>`\nand `<Column>`. This is because the parent column\n`<Column lg={16} md={8} sm={4} className=\"landing-page__r2\">` is acting as a\nfaux row, and each tab within that row contains the actual column content. When\nnesting columns, you must always wrap the nested group within another `<Grid>`.\n\nHold up! If you were to run the\n[Equal Access Toolkit](https://www.ibm.com/able/toolkit) to check for\naccessibility violations, you'd see\n`Multiple navigation landmarks must have unique labels specified with aria-label or aria-labelledby`\nbecause both the `Breadcrumb` and `Tabs` components use `<nav>` elements. To\nfix, add `aria-label` to the `Breadcrumb` opening tag:\n\n```jsx\n<Breadcrumb noTrailingSlash aria-label=\"Page navigation\">\n```\n\nSame goes for the `TabList` opening tag:\n\n```jsx\n<TabList className=\"tabs-group\" aria-label=\"Tab navigation\">\n```\n\nNext, we'll need to add some styling overrides to move the tabs to the right on\nlarge viewports. Create a file `_overrides.scss` in `src/content/LandingPage`\nwith this declaration block.\n\n```scss path=src/content/LandingPage/_overrides.scss\n.landing-page__r2 .cds--tabs--scrollable {\n  transform: translateZ(0);\n  justify-content: flex-end;\n}\n\n.landing-page__r2 .cds--tab-content {\n  padding: 0;\n}\n\n.cds--tab--list {\n  justify-content: flex-end;\n  padding-right: 1rem;\n}\n\n.cds--subgrid--wide {\n  //fix needed to keep the subgrid from scrolling horizontally\n  margin-right: 1rem;\n}\n```\n\nThen in `_landing-page.scss` add this import at the top of the file.\n\n```scss path=src/content/LandingPage/_landing-page.scss\n@use './overrides.scss';\n```\n\n<InlineNotification>\n\n**Note:** We don't have to include this in a separate file, but it's nice to\nkeep overrides separate from your application's styling so when migrating to\nfuture Carbon versions and if there are breaking changes via different class\nnames, you have a consolidated list of styling declaration blocks to review.\n\n</InlineNotification>\n\nWe can now add our images and text for each column in the first `Tab` in\n`LandingPage.js`.\n\n```jsx path=src/content/LandingPage/LandingPage.js\n<Column md={4} lg={{ span: 8, offset: 7 }} sm={4}>\n  <img\n    className=\"landing-page__illo\"\n    src={`${process.env.PUBLIC_URL}/tab-illo.png`}\n    alt=\"Carbon illustration\"\n  />\n</Column>\n```\n\nNow let's set the image size in `_landing-page.scss`:\n\n```scss path=src/content/LandingPage/_landing-page.scss\n.landing-page__illo {\n  max-width: 100%;\n}\n```\n\nAssuming that the second and third tab would have a similar design, we would set\nthem up in the same way. However, since our design specs don't show those tabs,\nwe'll leave the code as is.\n\n### Third row\n\nThe third row will be created in a later tutorial, so we'll just add the headers\nfor now.\n\n```jsx path=src/content/LandingPage/LandingPage.js\n<Column lg={16} md={8} sm={4} className=\"landing-page__r3\">\n  <Grid>\n    <Column md={4} lg={4} sm={4}>\n      <h3 className=\"landing-page__label\">The Principles</h3>\n    </Column>\n    <Column md={4} lg={4} sm={4}>\n      Carbon is Open\n    </Column>\n    <Column md={4} lg={4} sm={4}>\n      Carbon is Modular\n    </Column>\n    <Column md={4} lg={4} sm={4}>\n      Carbon is Consistent\n    </Column>\n  </Grid>\n</Column>\n```\n\n## Style landing page\n\nWe've added basic layout styles in `_landing-page.scss`, so now let's add type,\ncolor, and spacing styles to match the design. We'll be using our\n[spacing tokens](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/guidelines/spacing/overview).\nIn `_landing-page.scss`, add these imports at the **top** of the file (above our\noverrides import) so we can use Carbon breakpoints, tokens, and typography Sass\nmixins and functions:\n\n```scss path=src/content/LandingPage/_landing-page.scss\n@use '@carbon/react/scss/spacing' as *;\n@use '@carbon/react/scss/type' as *;\n@use '@carbon/react/scss/breakpoint' as *;\n@use '@carbon/react/scss/theme' as *;\n```\n\n### Banner\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Banner vertical spacing](../shared/step-2/images/landing-r1-spacing.png)\n\n<Caption>Banner vertical spacing</Caption>\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n<InlineNotification>\n\n**Pro tip:** `CTRL-G` toggles the grid in Sketch.\n\n</InlineNotification>\n\nBack to `_landing-page.scss`, we need to add space above the breadcrumb and\nbelow the heading. For that, add:\n\n```scss path=src/content/LandingPage/_landing-page.scss\n.landing-page__banner {\n  padding-top: $spacing-05;\n  padding-bottom: $spacing-07 * 4;\n  padding-left: $spacing-06;\n}\n```\n\nReferencing the\n[spacing token table](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/guidelines/spacing/overview#spacing-scale),\n`16px` can be set with the `$spacing-05` token. The design calls for `128px` of\nspace below the heading and that's not in the spacing scale. We can achieve this\nin Sass by multiplying 32px (`$spacing-07`) by 4. We could use `128px` or `8rem`\ndirectly in our styling, but using our tokens preserves consistency should the\ntoken values get updated in the future.\n\nLooking at the design, we need a wall-to-wall light gray background behind the\nbanner and also behind the third row. This is a great opportunity to use a Sass\nmixin. We could put this at the top of `_landing-page.scss`, but it's best\npractice to place mixins in a dedicated file, so create a `_mixins.scss` file in\n`src/content/LandingPage`.\n\nAdd the following in `_mixins.scss`. Per the design we need to use Gray 10 for\nour banner background color, which can be set with the `$layer-01`\n[color token](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/guidelines/color/usage). Also,\nwe want the background to extend into the grid's outermost gutters to go the\nfull width of the viewport, so given the DOM structure, we can achieve that by\nsetting the background in an absolutely positioned pseudo element.\n\n```scss path=src/content/LandingPage/_mixins.scss\n@use '@carbon/react/scss/spacing' as *;\n@use '@carbon/react/scss/theme' as *;\n\n@mixin landing-page-background() {\n  background-color: $layer-01;\n  position: relative;\n}\n```\n\nAfter you have created `_mixins.scss`, import it at the **top** of\n`_landing-page.scss`. By now you should have six imports:\n\n```scss path=src/content/LandingPage/_landing-page.scss\n@use '@carbon/react/scss/spacing' as *;\n@use '@carbon/react/scss/type' as *;\n@use '@carbon/react/scss/breakpoint' as *;\n@use '@carbon/react/scss/theme' as *;\n@use './mixins.scss' as *;\n@use './overrides.scss';\n```\n\nNow to use the new mixin, update the `.landing-page__banner` declaration block\nto:\n\n```scss path=src/content/LandingPage/_landing-page.scss\n.landing-page__banner {\n  padding-top: $spacing-05;\n  padding-bottom: $spacing-07 * 4;\n  padding-left: $spacing-06;\n  @include landing-page-background;\n}\n```\n\nNext, we can see that the `h1` is using the `heading-05` type token.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Banner heading type](../shared/step-2/images/landing-r1-type.png)\n\n<Caption>Banner heading type</Caption>\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\nThe Sketch symbol naming is consistent with the development Sass tokens to help\ntranslate design to development. So, looking up the\n[type token](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/guidelines/typography/productive),\nwe know to use `productive-heading-05`:\n\n```scss path=src/content/LandingPage/_landing-page.scss\n.landing-page__heading {\n  @include type-style('productive-heading-05');\n}\n```\n\n### Row two\n\nFor our second row, we need to fix the tabs vertical positioning to match the\ndesign. By inspecting the tabs component, you can see that the tab height\ncomputes to `40px`. We can use that to create our negative top margin in rem\nunits.\n\n```scss path=src/content/LandingPage/_landing-page.scss\n.landing-page__r2 {\n  margin-top: rem(-40px);\n}\n```\n\nWe also need to adjust our vertical spacing and type treatment. Like before,\nit's a matter of using spacing and type tokens like so:\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Row 2 vertical spacing](../shared/step-2/images/landing-r2-spacing.png)\n\n<Caption>Row 2 vertical spacing</Caption>\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n<InlineNotification>\n\n**Note:** You may be wondering why there are vertical gaps between the type and\nspacers. Each type token has a line height that's suited for its font size. The\nvertical spacers adjacently touch the line height boundaries and not the\nbaseline, for consistency as well as development ease so `margins` and\n`paddings` don't need to offset line heights.\n\n</InlineNotification>\n\n```scss path=src/content/LandingPage/_landing-page.scss\n.tabs-group-content {\n  padding: $spacing-10 $spacing-06;\n}\n\n.landing-page__subheading {\n  @include type-style('productive-heading-03');\n\n  font-weight: 600;\n}\n\n.landing-page__p {\n  @include type-style('productive-heading-03');\n  margin-top: $spacing-06;\n  margin-bottom: $spacing-08;\n\n  @include breakpoint-between((320px + 1), md) {\n    max-width: 75%;\n  }\n}\n\n.tabs-group {\n  background-color: $layer-01;\n}\n```\n\n### Row three\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Row 3 vertical spacing](../shared/step-2/images/landing-r3-spacing.png)\n\n<Caption>Row 3 vertical spacing</Caption>\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\nLet's also add some styles for the last row, even though that will get used\nlater in the tutorial. You'll notice that we get to re-use the\n`landing-page-background` mixin that we just created.\n\n```scss path=src/content/LandingPage/_landing-page.scss\n.landing-page__r3 {\n  padding-top: $spacing-09;\n  padding-bottom: $spacing-09;\n  padding-left: $spacing-06;\n  @include landing-page-background;\n}\n\n.landing-page__label {\n  @include type-style('heading-01');\n}\n```\n\nLastly, we'll fix some grid alignment issues. We'll use one of our breakpoint\nmixins for the media queries, like so:\n\n```scss path=src/content/LandingPage/_landing-page.scss\n.landing-page__banner,\n.landing-page__r2,\n.landing-page__r3 {\n  margin-left: -20px;\n  margin-right: -20px;\n\n  @include breakpoint-down(md) {\n    margin-left: 0;\n    margin-right: 0;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nWe are almost done with the landing page. You may notice a few styles are off.\nTo fix this, we'll update some of the overriding styles in `index.scss`. We\nalready have some overriding styles for `.cds--content`. We need to add\n`padding: 0;` to this selector and add one more selector for the grid below\nthat:\n\n```scss path=src/index.scss\n.cds--content {\n  margin-top: 3rem;\n  padding: 0;\n  background: var(--cds-background);\n}\n\n.cds--content .cds--css-grid {\n  max-width: 100%;\n  @include breakpoint(md) {\n    padding-left: 20px;\n    padding-right: 20px;\n  }\n}\n```\n\nSince we are using out `breakpoint` mixin, we need to import the styles for that\nbelow our Carbon styles import:\n\n```scss path=src/index.scss\n@use '@carbon/react';\n@use '@carbon/react/scss/breakpoint' as *;\n```\n\nTa-da! You should see a finished landing page! Now we can move on to the repo\npage.\n\n## Add repo page grid\n\nNow in our `RepoPage.js` we'll import our `Grid` components at the top:\n\n```javascript path=src/content/RepoPage/RepoPage.js\nimport { Grid, Column } from '@carbon/react';\n```\n\nThen add our grid containers in the `return` section.\n\n```javascript path=src/content/RepoPage/RepoPage.js\nreturn (\n  <Grid className=\"repo-page\">\n    <Column lg={16} className=\"repo-page__r1\">\n      Data table will go here\n    </Column>\n  </Grid>\n);\n```\n\n## Build repo page\n\nWe currently have `RepoPage.js` that just contains a grid and placeholder\ncontent for the time being. In the next tutorial step we're going to be querying\nan API to populate the `DataTable` component in this page. As a best practice to\nseparate data fetching from the presentation components, go ahead and create a\n`RepoTable.js` as a sibling to `RepoPage.js` in `src/content/RepoPage`.\n\n### Build data table\n\nFirst, we'll add our data table by importing a few components in `RepoTable.js`:\n\n```javascript path=src/content/RepoPage/RepoTable.js\nimport React from 'react';\nimport {\n  DataTable,\n  TableContainer,\n  Table,\n  TableHead,\n  TableRow,\n  TableExpandHeader,\n  TableHeader,\n  TableBody,\n  TableExpandRow,\n  TableCell,\n  TableExpandedRow,\n} from '@carbon/react';\n```\n\nThen, let's create the `RepoTable` component and export it at the very bottom of\n`RepoTable.js`.\n\n```javascript path=src/content/RepoPage/RepoTable.js\nconst RepoTable = ({ rows, headers }) => {\n  return (\n    <DataTable\n      rows={rows}\n      headers={headers}\n      render={({\n        rows,\n        headers,\n        getHeaderProps,\n        getRowProps,\n        getTableProps,\n      }) => (\n        <TableContainer\n          title=\"Carbon Repositories\"\n          description=\"A collection of public Carbon repositories.\"\n        >\n          <Table {...getTableProps()}>\n            <TableHead>\n              <TableRow>\n                <TableExpandHeader />\n                {headers.map((header) => (\n                  <TableHeader {...getHeaderProps({ header })}>\n                    {header.header}\n                  </TableHeader>\n                ))}\n              </TableRow>\n            </TableHead>\n            <TableBody>\n              {rows.map((row) => (\n                <React.Fragment key={row.id}>\n                  <TableExpandRow {...getRowProps({ row })}>\n                    {row.cells.map((cell) => (\n                      <TableCell key={cell.id}>{cell.value}</TableCell>\n                    ))}\n                  </TableExpandRow>\n                  <TableExpandedRow colSpan={headers.length + 1}>\n                    <p>Row description</p>\n                  </TableExpandedRow>\n                </React.Fragment>\n              ))}\n            </TableBody>\n          </Table>\n        </TableContainer>\n      )}\n    />\n  );\n};\n\nexport default RepoTable;\n```\n\nThis component uses two props, `rows` and `headers`, and returns a Carbon\n`DataTable`. As for where the various `Table*` components came from? The\n[DataTable story](https://react.carbondesignsystem.com/?path=/story/components-datatable-expansion--usage)\nin Storybook was used to put together the data table structure.\n\n<InlineNotification>\n\n**Note:** The `getTableProps`, `getHeaderProps`, and `getRowProps` functions\neach tell the `DataTable` component to process and return the necessary props\nthat are needed by the `Table`, `TableHeader` and `TableRow` components\nrespectively. We take the return of that function (an object containing the\nprops) and\n[spread it out](https://reactjs.org/docs/jsx-in-depth.html#spread-attributes)\ninto the component.\n\n</InlineNotification>\n\nAt this point, return to `RepoPage.js` because now we need to render a static\n`RepoTable`.\n\n### Render data table\n\nImport `RepoTable` in `RepoPage.js`.\n\n```javascript path=src/content/RepoPage/RepoPage.js\nimport React from 'react';\nimport RepoTable from './RepoTable';\nimport { Grid, Column } from '@carbon/react';\n```\n\nThen below the imports, include the following arrays to pass into the\n`RepoTable` component. We'll be setting the `rows` array from an API in the next\ntutorial step, but for now, static example rows will suffice.\n\n```javascript path=src/content/RepoPage/RepoPage.js\nconst headers = [\n  {\n    key: 'name',\n    header: 'Name',\n  },\n  {\n    key: 'createdAt',\n    header: 'Created',\n  },\n  {\n    key: 'updatedAt',\n    header: 'Updated',\n  },\n  {\n    key: 'issueCount',\n    header: 'Open Issues',\n  },\n  {\n    key: 'stars',\n    header: 'Stars',\n  },\n  {\n    key: 'links',\n    header: 'Links',\n  },\n];\n\nconst rows = [\n  {\n    id: '1',\n    name: 'Repo 1',\n    createdAt: 'Date',\n    updatedAt: 'Date',\n    issueCount: '123',\n    stars: '456',\n    links: 'Links',\n  },\n  {\n    id: '2',\n    name: 'Repo 2',\n    createdAt: 'Date',\n    updatedAt: 'Date',\n    issueCount: '123',\n    stars: '456',\n    links: 'Links',\n  },\n  {\n    id: '3',\n    name: 'Repo 3',\n    createdAt: 'Date',\n    updatedAt: 'Date',\n    issueCount: '123',\n    stars: '456',\n    links: 'Links',\n  },\n];\n```\n\nLastly in `RepoPage.js`, we need to simply replace `Data table will go here`\nwith:\n\n```jsx path=src/content/RepoPage/RepoPage.js\n<RepoTable headers={headers} rows={rows} />\n```\n\n## Style repo page\n\nOur styles for the repo page are mostly fine. We just need to update a few\nvertical spacing issues.\n\nIn `_repo-page.scss`, add the following styles:\n\n```scss path=src/content/RepoPage/_repo-page.scss\n@use '@carbon/react/scss/spacing' as *;\n\n.repo-page__r1 {\n  padding-top: $spacing-05;\n  padding-bottom: $spacing-05;\n}\n```\n\nCongratulations!
