So far, we've only used Carbon components to build out two\npages.\n\nNext, we're going to use Carbon assets to build application-specific components.\nWe'll do so by including accessibility and responsive considerations all\nthroughout.\n\nA [preview](https://vue-step-5--carbon-tutorial-vue.netlify.com) of what you'll\nbuild (see bottom of page):\n\n<Preview\n  height=\"400\"\n  title=\"Carbon Tutorial Step 4\"\n  src=\"https://vue-step-5--carbon-tutorial-vue.netlify.com\"\n  frameborder=\"no\"\n  allowtransparency=\"true\"\n  allowfullscreen=\"true\"\n/>\n\n## Fork, clone and branch\n\nThis tutorial has an accompanying GitHub repository called\n[carbon-tutorial](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-tutorial-vue)\nthat we'll use as a starting point for each step. If you haven't forked and\ncloned that repository yet, and haven't added the upstream remote, go ahead and\ndo so by following the\n[step 1 instructions](/developing/vue-tutorial/step-1#fork-clone-and-branch).\n\n### Branch\n\nWith your repository all set up, let's check out the branch for this tutorial\nstep's starting point.\n\n```bash\ngit fetch upstream\ngit checkout -b vue-step-4 upstream/vue-step-4\n```\n\n<InlineNotification>\n\n**Note:** This builds on top of step 3, but be sure to check out the upstream\nstep 4 branch because it includes the static assets required to get through this\nstep.\n\n</InlineNotification>\n\n### Build and start app\n\nInstall the app's dependencies (in case you're starting fresh in your current\ndirectory and not continuing from the previous step):\n\n```bash\nyarn\n```\n\nThen, start the app:\n\n```bash\nyarn serve\n```\n\nYou should see something similar to where the\n[previous step](/developing/vue-tutorial/step-3) left off.\n\n## Review design\n\nHere's what we're building – an informational section that has a heading and\nthree subheadings. Each subheading has accompanying copy and a pictogram. We'll\nassume that this informational section is used elsewhere on the site, meaning\nit's a great opportunity to build it as a reusable component. As for naming,\nwe'll call it an `InfoSection` with three `InfoCard`s as children.\n\n![Info section layout](../shared/step-4/images/info-layout.png)\n\n<Caption>Info section layout</Caption>\n\n## Create components\n\nFirst we need files for the components, so create an `InfoSection` folder in\n`src/components`. Even though we're building multiple components, their names\nall start with `Info`, so it makes sense to have them share one folder in\ncomponents. Create these files:\n\n### Add files\n\n```bash\nsrc/components/InfoSection\n├──index.js\n└──InfoCard.vue\n└──InfoSection.vue\n```\n\nLike our other components, `index.js` will serve as an entrypoint.\n\n<InlineNotification>\n\n**Note:** To adhere to the [Vue style guide](https://vuejs.org/v2/style-guide/)\nwe have used multi word component names. This style guide stipulation is why all\n`@carbon/vue` components have a `cv` prefix.\n\n</InlineNotification>\n\n```javascript path=src/components/InfoSection/index.js\nimport InfoSection from './InfoSection';\nimport InfoCard from './InfoCard';\n\nexport { InfoSection, InfoCard };\n```\n\n### InfoSection component\n\nLet's create the parent component that includes the \"The Principles\" heading.\nThat markup currently looks like this in `LandingPage.vue`:\n\n```html path=src/views/LandingPage/LandingPage.vue\n<div class=\"cds--row landing-page__r3\">\n  <div class=\"cds--col-md-4 cds--col-lg-4\">\n    <h3 class=\"landing-page__label\">The Principles</h3>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"cds--col-md-4 cds--col-lg-4\">Carbon is Open</div>\n  <div class=\"cds--col-md-4 cds--col-lg-4\">Carbon is Modular</div>\n  <div class=\"cds--col-md-4 cds--col-lg-4\">Carbon is Consistent</div>\n</div>\n```\n\nWe want to do a few things when abstracting it to a component. First, we only\nwant Carbon (`cds--`) and this component's class names; we don't want to include\n`landing-page__r3` as that's specific to the landing page. That will be passed\nin as a property to the component.\n\nWe'll also:\n\n- Add component class names like `info-section` and `info-section__heading`\n- Semantically use `<section>` instead of `<div>`\n- Update the grid columns to match the design\n- Replace `The Principles` with `{{heading}}`\n- Replace columns 2 - 4 with a slot.\n\nUsing `props` we can render any heading and any number of children components\n(`InfoCard` that we'll build soon.)\n\n```html path=src/components/InfoSection/InfoSection.vue\n<template>\n  <section class=\"cds--row info-section\">\n    <div class=\"cds--col-md-8 cds--col-lg-4 cds--col-xlg-3\">\n      <h3 class=\"info-section__heading\">{{ heading }}</h3>\n    </div>\n    <slot />\n  </section>\n</template>\n```\n\nThen name our component and add a property to the script section.\n\n```javascript path=src/components/InfoSection/InfoSection.vue\n<script>\nexport default {\n  name: \"InfoSection\",\n  props: {\n    heading: String\n  }\n};\n</script>\n```\n\nAt this point let's add styling for the new class names that we just added.\n\n```scss path=src/components/InfoSection/InfoSection.vue\n<style lang=\"scss\">\n@import \"../../styles/_carbon-utils\";\n\n.info-section__heading {\n  @include type-style('heading-01');\n}\n</style>\n```\n\n### InfoCard component\n\nNext up we're going to build a component for columns 2 - 4, which currently\nlooks like `<div class=\"cds--col-md-4 cds--col-lg-4\">Carbon is Open</div>`.\nCreate a new file InfoCard.vue, add:\n\n```html path=src/components/InfoSection/InfoCard.vue\n<template>\n  <article\n    class=\"info-card cds--col-md-4 cds--col-lg-4 cds--col-xlg-3 cds--offset-xlg-1\"\n  >\n    <h4 class=\"info-card__heading\">{{ heading }}</h4>\n    <p class=\"info-card__body\">{{ body }}</p>\n    <component :is=\"icon\" />\n  </article>\n</template>\n```\n\nGive it a name and add props\n\n```javascript\n<script>\nexport default {\n  name: \"InfoCard\",\n  props: {\n    heading: String,\n    body: String,\n    icon: Object\n  }\n};\n</script>\n```\n\n<InlineNotification>\n\n**Note:** Make sure to export the two components from index.js!\n\n</InlineNotification>\n\nIn doing so, we:\n\n- Used the semantic `<article>` instead of `<div>`\n- Added `info-card` classes\n- Used `props` to render the heading, body copy, and icon\n- Set columns to match the grid\n\n<InlineNotification>\n\n**Note:** At extra large viewports, we are using\n`cds--col-xlg-3 cds--offset-xlg-1` so each column takes up 3 of the 16 grid\ncolumns, with a 1 column offset.\n\n</InlineNotification>\n\n## Use components\n\nOur styling is not complete yet, but with our components built let's put them to\nuse. In `LandingPage.vue`, import the components towards the top of the script\nsection. If you haven't added a script section, do so now.\n\n```javascript path=src/views/LandingPage/LandingPage.vue\n<script>\nimport { InfoSection, InfoCard } from '../../components/InfoSection';\n\nexport default {\n  name: 'LandingPage',\n  components: { InfoSection, InfoCard }\n};\n</script>\n```\n\nWhile we're here next to the component imports, let's import the icons that\nwe'll need as well.\n\n```javascript path=src/views/LandingPage/LandingPage.vue\nimport { Globe32, PersonFavorite32, Application32 } from '@carbon/icons-vue';\n```\n\n<InlineNotification>\n\n**Note:** You'll notice that these 32px icons aren't the pictograms as designed.\nThe Carbon team is currently working on adding pictograms to the icons packages.\nUntil then, we'll use the biggest SVGs.\n\n</InlineNotification>\n\nDon't forget to add the icons to the list of components used in our template.\nWait a minute, are they being used by our template? Well, yes and no. The\ncomponents are going to be passed as an attribute rather than being used as a\nDOM element. Vue treats this use case differently and instead of adding to the\ncomponents property, we need to assign the icons directly to the `this` object.\nWe can achieve this in a number of different ways, for example as data or\ncomputed properties. The following is our preferred method when reactivity is\nnot needed.\n\nIn the script section of the component add the lifecycle method `created()` to\nadd the icons to the component.\n\n```javascript path=src/views/LandingPage/LandingPage.vue\n  created() {\n    // Add icons to this\n    Object.assign(this, {\n      Globe32,\n      PersonFavorite32,\n      Application32\n    });\n  }\n```\n\nWith everything imported, replace the current template content:\n\n```html path=src/views/LandingPage/LandingPage.vue\n<div class=\"cds--row landing-page__r3\">\n  <div class=\"cds--col-md-4 cds--col-lg-4\">\n    <h3 class=\"landing-page__label\">The Principles</h3>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"cds--col-md-4 cds--col-lg-4\">Carbon is Open</div>\n  <div class=\"cds--col-md-4 cds--col-lg-4\">Carbon is Modular</div>\n  <div class=\"cds--col-md-4 cds--col-lg-4\">Carbon is Consistent</div>\n</div>\n```\n\nWith the new components:\n\n<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->\n```html path=src/views/LandingPage/LandingPage.vue\n<info-section heading=\"The Principles\" class=\"landing-page__r3\">\n</info-section>\n```\n<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->\n\nThen slot the `InfoCard` content inside the `InfoSection` tag to give.\n\n<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->\n```html path=src/views/LandingPage/LandingPage.vue\n<info-section heading=\"The Principles\" class=\"landing-page__r3\">\n  <info-card\n    heading=\"Carbon is Open\"\n    body=\"It's a distributed effort, guided by the principles of the open-source movement. Carbon's users are also it's makers, and everyone is encouraged to contribute.\"\n    :icon=\"PersonFavorite32\"\n  />\n  <info-card\n    heading=\"Carbon is Modular\"\n    body=\"Carbon's modularity ensures maximum flexibility in execution. It's components are designed to work seamlessly with each other, in whichever combination suits the needs of the user.\"\n    :icon=\"Application32\"\n  />\n  <info-card\n    heading=\"Carbon is Consistent\"\n    body=\"Based on the comprehensive IBM Design Language, every element and component of Carbon was designed from the ground up to work elegantly together to ensure consistent, cohesive user experiences.\"\n    :icon=\"Globe32\"\n  />\n</info-section>\n```\n<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->\n\n<InlineNotification>\n\n**Note:** Now is a good time to resize your browser from phone to extra large\nviewport widths to see how the responsive grid is working before we add further\nstyling.\n\n</InlineNotification>\n\n## Add styling\n\nHere's our design showing the spacing tokens that we need to add. We also need\nto set the type style and borders.\n\n![Info section spacing](../shared/step-4/images/info-spacing.png)\n\n<Caption>Info section spacing</Caption>\n\n### Layout\n\nStarting with layout, add the style section to\n`src/components/InfoSection/InfoCard.vue`.\n\n```scss path=src/components/InfoSection/InfoCard.vue\n<style lang=\"scss\">\n@import \"../../styles/carbon-utils\";\n\n.info-card {\n  margin-top: $spacing-09;\n  display: flex;\n  flex-direction: column;\n\n  svg {\n    margin-top: $spacing-09;\n  }\n\n  // top border in only small breakpoints to prevent overrides\n  @include breakpoint-down(md) {\n    &:not(:nth-child(2)) {\n      border-top: 1px solid $ui-03;\n      padding-top: $spacing-09;\n    }\n  }\n\n  // left border in just the 2nd column items\n  @include breakpoint(md) {\n    &:nth-child(odd) {\n      border-left: 1px solid $ui-03;\n    }\n  }\n\n  // left border in all items\n  @include breakpoint(lg) {\n    margin-top: 0;\n    border-left: 1px solid $ui-03;\n\n    svg {\n      margin-top: $layout-06;\n    }\n  }\n}\n</style>\n```\n\nOnce you save, go ahead and resize your browser to see the responsive layout at\nthe different breakpoints. Make sure to review these color and spacing tokens.\nThere are also a few breakpoint mixins that may be new to you.\n\n### Type\n\nOur `InfoCard` headings look to be too small. We need to increase their font\nsizes according to the design spec with:\n\n```scss path=src/components/InfoSection/InfoCard.vue\n.info-card__heading {\n  @include type-style('productive-heading-03');\n}\n```\n\nAlso, the design has the last word in each subheading as bold. To accomplish\nthat, add this computed property to `InfoCard.vue`.\n\n```javascript path=src/components/InfoSection/InfoCard.vue\ncomputed: {\n  // Take in a phrase and separate the third word in an array\n  splitHeading() {\n    const splitHeading = this.heading.split(\" \");\n    const finalWord = splitHeading.pop();\n    return [splitHeading.join(\" \"), finalWord];\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThen, update `InfoCard.vue` to use `splitHeading`.\n\nReplacing\n\n```html path=src/components/InfoSection/InfoCard.vue\n<h4 class=\"info-card__heading\">{{heading}}</h4>\n```\n\nwith\n\n```html path=src/components/InfoSection/InfoCard.vue\n<h4 class=\"info-card__heading\">\n  {{ splitHeading[0] }}\n  <strong>{{ splitHeading[1] }}</strong>\n</h4>\n```\n\nFinally, add the following declaration block in the style section of\n`InfoCard.vue` to set body copy styles and to bottom-align the icons.\n\n```scss path=src/components/InfoSection/InfoCard.vue\n.info-card__body {\n  margin-top: $spacing-06;\n  flex-grow: 1; // fill space so icons are bottom aligned\n  @include type-style('body-long-01');\n\n  // prevent large line lengths between small and medium viewports\n  @include breakpoint-between(321px, md) {\n    max-width: 75%;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Check accessibility\n\nWe've added new markup and styles, so it's a good practice to check\n[DAP](https://www.ibm.com/able/dynamic-assessment-plug-in.html) and make sure\nour rendered markup is on the right track for accessibility.\n\nWith the browser extension installed, Chrome in this example, open Dev Tools and\nrun DAP.\n\n![DAP violations](../shared/step-4/images/DAP-violations.png)\n\n<Caption>DAP violations</Caption>\n\nThat first violation is for the off-screen \"skip to content\" link. This link\nisn't shown and is used to assist screen reading, so the color contrast\nviolation can be ignored.\n\nBut, those three other violations came from the `<article>` element used in new\n`InfoCard`. Since the `<article>` element requires a label, it seems like we may\nbe using the wrong semantic element. A humble `<div>` will suffice.\n\nIn `InfoCard.vue`, replace the `<article>` opening and closing tags with `<div>`\ntags.\n\nAlso it's time to fix it if you didn't but I'm sure you can manage that by\nyourself.\n\n## Submit pull request\n\nWe're going to submit a pull request to verify completion of this tutorial step.\n\n### Continuous integration (CI) check\n\nRun the CI check to make sure we're all set to submit a pull request.\n\n```bash\nyarn ci-check\n```\n\n<InlineNotification>\n\n**Note:** Having issues running the CI check?\n[Step 1](/developing/vue-tutorial/step-1#continuous-integration-ci-check) has\ntroubleshooting notes that may help.\n\n</InlineNotification>\n\n### Git commit and push\n\nBefore we can create a pull request, stage and commit all of your changes:\n\n```bash\ngit add --all && git commit -m \"feat(tutorial): complete step 4\"\n```\n\nThen, push to your repository:\n\n```bash\ngit push origin vue-step-4\n```\n\n<InlineNotification>\n\n**Note:** Having issues pushing your changes?\n[Step 1](/developing/vue-tutorial/step-1#git-commit-and-push) has\ntroubleshooting notes that may help.\n\n</InlineNotification>\n\n### Pull request (PR)\n\nFinally, visit\n[carbon-tutorial](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-tutorial) to\n\"Compare & pull request\". In doing so, make sure that you are comparing to\n`vue-step-4` into `base: vue-step-4`.\n\n<InlineNotification>\n\n**Note:** Expect your tutorial step PRs to be reviewed by the Carbon team but\nnot merged. We'll close your PR so we can keep the repository's remote branches\npristine and ready for the next person!\n\n</InlineNotification>\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"6d20257f92d044bc538f0e2919567c95","owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx","counter":4056},"frontmatter":{"title":"4.

If you haven't added a script section, do so now.\n\n```javascript path=src/views/LandingPage/LandingPage.vue\n<script>\nimport { InfoSection, InfoCard } from '../../components/InfoSection';\n\nexport default {\n  name: 'LandingPage',\n  components: { InfoSection, InfoCard }\n};\n</script>\n```\n\nWhile we're here next to the component imports, let's import the icons that\nwe'll need as well.\n\n```javascript path=src/views/LandingPage/LandingPage.vue\nimport { Globe32, PersonFavorite32, Application32 } from '@carbon/icons-vue';\n```\n\n<InlineNotification>\n\n**Note:** You'll notice that these 32px icons aren't the pictograms as designed.\nThe Carbon team is currently working on adding pictograms to the icons packages.\nUntil then, we'll use the biggest SVGs.\n\n</InlineNotification>\n\nDon't forget to add the icons to the list of components used in our template.\nWait a minute, are they being used by our template? Well, yes and no. The\ncomponents are going to be passed as an attribute rather than being used as a\nDOM element. Vue treats this use case differently and instead of adding to the\ncomponents property, we need to assign the icons directly to the `this` object.\nWe can achieve this in a number of different ways, for example as data or\ncomputed properties. The following is our preferred method when reactivity is\nnot needed.\n\nIn the script section of the component add the lifecycle method `created()` to\nadd the icons to the component.\n\n```javascript path=src/views/LandingPage/LandingPage.vue\n  created() {\n    // Add icons to this\n    Object.assign(this, {\n      Globe32,\n      PersonFavorite32,\n      Application32\n    });\n  }\n```\n\nWith everything imported, replace the current template content:\n\n```html path=src/views/LandingPage/LandingPage.vue\n<div class=\"cds--row landing-page__r3\">\n  <div class=\"cds--col-md-4 cds--col-lg-4\">\n    <h3 class=\"landing-page__label\">The Principles</h3>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"cds--col-md-4 cds--col-lg-4\">Carbon is Open</div>\n  <div class=\"cds--col-md-4 cds--col-lg-4\">Carbon is Modular</div>\n  <div class=\"cds--col-md-4 cds--col-lg-4\">Carbon is Consistent</div>\n</div>\n```\n\nWith the new components:\n\n<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->\n```html path=src/views/LandingPage/LandingPage.vue\n<info-section heading=\"The Principles\" class=\"landing-page__r3\">\n</info-section>\n```\n<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->\n\nThen slot the `InfoCard` content inside the `InfoSection` tag to give.\n\n<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->\n```html path=src/views/LandingPage/LandingPage.vue\n<info-section heading=\"The Principles\" class=\"landing-page__r3\">\n  <info-card\n    heading=\"Carbon is Open\"\n    body=\"It's a distributed effort, guided by the principles of the open-source movement. Carbon's users are also it's makers, and everyone is encouraged to contribute.\"\n    :icon=\"PersonFavorite32\"\n  />\n  <info-card\n    heading=\"Carbon is Modular\"\n    body=\"Carbon's modularity ensures maximum flexibility in execution. It's components are designed to work seamlessly with each other, in whichever combination suits the needs of the user.\"\n    :icon=\"Application32\"\n  />\n  <info-card\n    heading=\"Carbon is Consistent\"\n    body=\"Based on the comprehensive IBM Design Language, every element and component of Carbon was designed from the ground up to work elegantly together to ensure consistent, cohesive user experiences.\"\n    :icon=\"Globe32\"\n  />\n</info-section>\n```\n<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->\n\n<InlineNotification>\n\n**Note:** Now is a good time to resize your browser from phone to extra large\nviewport widths to see how the responsive grid is working before we add further\nstyling.\n\n</InlineNotification>\n\n## Add styling\n\nHere's our design showing the spacing tokens that we need to add. We also need\nto set the type style and borders.\n\n![Info section spacing](../shared/step-4/images/info-spacing.png)\n\n<Caption>Info section spacing</Caption>\n\n### Layout\n\nStarting with layout, add the style section to\n`src/components/InfoSection/InfoCard.vue`.\n\n```scss path=src/components/InfoSection/InfoCard.vue\n<style lang=\"scss\">\n@import \"../../styles/carbon-utils\";\n\n.info-card {\n  margin-top: $spacing-09;\n  display: flex;\n  flex-direction: column;\n\n  svg {\n    margin-top: $spacing-09;\n  }\n\n  // top border in only small breakpoints to prevent overrides\n  @include breakpoint-down(md) {\n    &:not(:nth-child(2)) {\n      border-top: 1px solid $ui-03;\n      padding-top: $spacing-09;\n    }\n  }\n\n  // left border in just the 2nd column items\n  @include breakpoint(md) {\n    &:nth-child(odd) {\n      border-left: 1px solid $ui-03;\n    }\n  }\n\n  // left border in all items\n  @include breakpoint(lg) {\n    margin-top: 0;\n    border-left: 1px solid $ui-03;\n\n    svg {\n      margin-top: $layout-06;\n    }\n  }\n}\n</style>\n```\n\nOnce you save, go ahead and resize your browser to see the responsive layout at\nthe different breakpoints. Make sure to review these color and spacing tokens.\nThere are also a few breakpoint mixins that may be new to you.\n\n### Type\n\nOur `InfoCard` headings look to be too small. We need to increase their font\nsizes according to the design spec with:\n\n```scss path=src/components/InfoSection/InfoCard.vue\n.info-card__heading {\n  @include type-style('productive-heading-03');\n}\n```\n\nAlso, the design has the last word in each subheading as bold. To accomplish\nthat, add this computed property to `InfoCard.vue`.\n\n```javascript path=src/components/InfoSection/InfoCard.vue\ncomputed: {\n  // Take in a phrase and separate the third word in an array\n  splitHeading() {\n    const splitHeading = this.heading.split(\" \");\n    const finalWord = splitHeading.pop();\n    return [splitHeading.join(\" \"), finalWord];\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThen, update `InfoCard.vue` to use `splitHeading`.\n\nReplacing\n\n```html path=src/components/InfoSection/InfoCard.vue\n<h4 class=\"info-card__heading\">{{heading}}</h4>\n```\n\nwith\n\n```html path=src/components/InfoSection/InfoCard.vue\n<h4 class=\"info-card__heading\">\n  {{ splitHeading[0] }}\n  <strong>{{ splitHeading[1] }}</strong>\n</h4>\n```\n\nFinally, add the following declaration block in the style section of\n`InfoCard.vue` to set body copy styles and to bottom-align the icons.\n\n```scss path=src/components/InfoSection/InfoCard.vue\n.info-card__body {\n  margin-top: $spacing-06;\n  flex-grow: 1; // fill space so icons are bottom aligned\n  @include type-style('body-long-01');\n\n  // prevent large line lengths between small and medium viewports\n  @include breakpoint-between(321px, md) {\n    max-width: 75%;\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Check accessibility\n\nWe've added new markup and styles, so it's a good practice to check\n[DAP](https://www.ibm.com/able/dynamic-assessment-plug-in.html) and make sure\nour rendered markup is on the right track for accessibility.\n\nWith the browser extension installed, Chrome in this example, open Dev Tools and\nrun DAP.\n\n![DAP violations](../shared/step-4/images/DAP-violations.png)\n\n<Caption>DAP violations</Caption>\n\nThat first violation is for the off-screen \"skip to content\" link. This link\nisn't shown and is used to assist screen reading, so the color contrast\nviolation can be ignored.\n\nBut, those three other violations came from the `<article>` element used in new\n`InfoCard`. Since the `<article>` element requires a label, it seems like we may\nbe using the wrong semantic element. A humble `<div>` will suffice.\n\nIn `InfoCard.vue`, replace the `<article>` opening and closing tags with `<div>`\ntags.\n\nAlso it's time to fix it if you didn't but I'm sure you can manage that by\nyourself.\n\n## Submit pull request\n\nWe're going to submit a pull request to verify completion of this tutorial step.\n\n### Continuous integration (CI) check\n\nRun the CI check to make sure we're all set to submit a pull request.\n\n```bash\nyarn ci-check\n```\n\n<InlineNotification>\n\n**Note:** Having issues running the CI check?\n[Step 1](/developing/vue-tutorial/step-1#continuous-integration-ci-check) has\ntroubleshooting notes that may help.\n\n</InlineNotification>\n\n### Git commit and push\n\nBefore we can create a pull request, stage and commit all of your changes:\n\n```bash\ngit add --all && git commit -m \"feat(tutorial): complete step 4\"\n```\n\nThen, push to your repository:\n\n```bash\ngit push origin vue-step-4\n```\n\n<InlineNotification>\n\n**Note:** Having issues pushing your changes?\n[Step 1](/developing/vue-tutorial/step-1#git-commit-and-push) has\ntroubleshooting notes that may help.\n\n</InlineNotification>\n\n### Pull request (PR)\n\nFinally, visit\n[carbon-tutorial](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-tutorial) to\n\"Compare & pull request\".
