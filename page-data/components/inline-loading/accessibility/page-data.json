Carbon also incorporates other\naccessibility considerations, some of which are described below.\n\n### Keyboard interaction\n\nThe inline loading component is not itself keyboard operable; however, when\ninline loading is in an active state, it may temporarily replace or disable an\nassociated component. For instance, if inline loading is showing the result of a\nbutton action, relevant input controls as well as other actions may be disabled\n(and so be inoperable) until the loading state changes to either error or\ncomplete.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![example of Cancel button in disabled state while the Submit button is replaced by inline loading icon and \"Submitting\" message](images/inline-loading-accessibility-1.png)\n\n<Caption>\n  Inline loading components are not interactive, but may temporarily disable\n  dependent components.\n</Caption>\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n### Labelling and states\n\nWhere there is displayed text for the inline loading, Carbon provides that text\nas the status to assistive technologies like screen readers.
