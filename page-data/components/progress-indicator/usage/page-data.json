This helps the user to know where\nthey are in relation to where they have been, and what sections are to follow.\nClear labels should accompany the progress indicator to indicate what the user\nwill accomplish within each step. Keep labels between one to two words.\n\n#### Validation\n\nUse validation to confirm that a previous step has been completed. If the user\ncannot proceed onto another step without first completing a task, use an\n[Inline Notification](/components/notification/code#inline-notification) to\ninform them.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Example of the progress indicator in a payment UI](images/progress-indicator-usage-1.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n## Feedback\n\nHelp us improve this component by providing feedback, asking questions, and\nleaving any other comments on\n[GitHub](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-website/issues/new?assignees=&labels=feedback&template=feedback.md).\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"15574266c4618c8de261ac22ee9fe9c5","owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx","counter":3969},"frontmatter":{"title":"Progress indicator","description":"A progress indicator is a visual representation of a user's progress through a set of steps, guiding toward the completion of a specified process.","tabs":["Usage","Style","Code","Accessibility"]},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: Progress indicator\ndescription:\n  A progress indicator is a visual representation of a user's progress through a\n  set of steps, guiding toward the completion of a specified process.\ntabs: ['Usage', 'Style', 'Code', 'Accessibility']\n---\n\n<PageDescription>\n\nA progress indicator is a visual representation of a user's progress through a\nset of steps, guiding toward the completion of a specified process.\n\n</PageDescription>\n\n<AnchorLinks>\n\n<AnchorLink>Overview</AnchorLink>\n<AnchorLink>Live demo</AnchorLink>\n<AnchorLink>Best practices</AnchorLink>\n<AnchorLink>Feedback</AnchorLink>\n\n</AnchorLinks>\n\n## Overview\n\nUse progress indicators to keep the user on track when completing a specific\ntask.
