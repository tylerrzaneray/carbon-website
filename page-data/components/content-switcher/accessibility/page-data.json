Each content switcher tab must have a unique title that clearly describes the\n   content panel. This is particularly helpful for users of assistive\n   technologies so they have the necessary information to efficiently navigate\n   the content.\n2. Carbon components should be used to create the content that displays within\n   each content panel.\n3. Content authors need to ensure the content that is added to the tab panel is\n   accessible. For example, if you add an image to the panel you need to include\n   alternative text to pass accessibility testing.\n\n## Resources\n\n- [W3C WAI-ARIA Tab Design Pattern](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/#tabpanel)\n  covers the usage of ARIA names, state and roles, as well as the expected\n  keyboard interactions.\n- [IBM Accessibility Requirements](https://www.ibm.com/able/requirements/requirements/):\n\n  - [1.3.1 Info and Relationships](https://www.ibm.com/able/requirements/requirements/#1_3_1)\n    (WCAG Success Criteria\n    [1.3.1](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/info-and-relationships))\n  - [1.3.2 Meaningful Sequence](https://www.ibm.com/able/requirements/requirements/#1_3_2)\n    (WCAG Success Criteria\n    [1.3.2](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/meaningful-sequence))\n\n## Accessibility testing\n\nAutomated, manual and screen reader accessibility verification test has been\nperformed on the Content Switcher React Carbon Component.\n[WCAG 2.1 Level A and AA success criteria](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) issues\nhave been identified and the list of open accessibility violations is available\nin the Carbon Component GitHub repository.\n\n### Automated test\n\n<Row>\n  <Column noGutterSm>\n    <StructuredListWrapper>\n      <StructuredListHead>\n        <StructuredListRow head>\n          <StructuredListCell head>\n            Automated test environment\n          </StructuredListCell>\n          <StructuredListCell head>Results</StructuredListCell>\n        </StructuredListRow>\n      </StructuredListHead>\n      <StructuredListBody>\n        <StructuredListRow>\n          <StructuredListCell>\n            - macOS Mojave version 10.14.2 with VoiceOver\n            <br />\n            - Chrome version 77.0.3865.90\n            <br />\n            - Dynamic Assessment Plugin (DAP) version 1.8.0.0 - IBM\n            Accessibility WCAG 2.1 Sept. 2019 Ruleset\n            <br />- Carbon React version 7.7.1\n          </StructuredListCell>\n          <StructuredListCell>\n            <strong>DAP test:</strong>\n            <br />- Violations\n          </StructuredListCell>\n        </StructuredListRow>\n      </StructuredListBody>\n    </StructuredListWrapper>\n  </Column>\n</Row>\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"b4139ce98c3a95e4b36330d7c3e2585b","owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx","counter":3899},"frontmatter":{"title":"Content switcher","description":"Content switchers manipulate the content shown following an exclusive or “either/or” pattern.
