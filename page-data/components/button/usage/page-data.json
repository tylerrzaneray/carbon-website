They\ncommunicate calls to action to the user and allow users to interact with pages\nin a variety of ways. Button labels express what action will occur when the user\ninteracts with it.\n\n#### When to use\n\nUse buttons to communicate actions users can take and to allow users to interact\nwith the page. Each page should have only one primary button, and any remaining\ncalls to action should be represented as lower emphasis buttons.\n\n#### When not to use\n\nDo not use buttons as navigational elements. Instead, use\n[links](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/link/usage) when the\ndesired action is to take the user to a new page.\n\n### Button variants\n\nEach button variant has a particular function and its design signals that\nfunction to the user. It is therefore very important that the different variants\nare implemented consistently across products, so that they message the correct\nactions.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={12}>\n\n![Button variants](images/button_usage_1.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n| Variant     | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| _Primary_   | For the principal call to action on the page. Primary buttons should only appear once per screen (not including the application header, modal dialog, or side panel).                                                                                                                                                                         |\n| _Secondary_ | For secondary actions on each page. Secondary buttons can only be used in conjunction with a primary button. As part of a pair, the secondary button's function is to perform the negative action of the set, such as \"Cancel\" or \"Back\". Do not use a secondary button in isolation and do not use a secondary button for a positive action. |\n| _Tertiary_  | For less prominent, and sometimes independent, actions. Tertiary buttons can be used in isolation or paired with a primary button when there are multiple calls to action. Tertiary buttons can also be used for sub-tasks on a page where a primary button for the main and final action is present.                                         |\n| _Danger_    | For actions that could have destructive effects on the user’s data (for example, delete or remove). Danger button has three styles: primary, tertiary, and ghost.                                                                                                                                                                             |\n| _Ghost_     | For the least pronounced actions; often used in conjunction with a primary button. In a situation such as a progress flow, a ghost button may be paired with a primary and secondary button set, where the primary button is for forward action, the secondary button is for \"Back\", and the ghost button is for \"Cancel\".                    |\n\n## Live demo\n\nimport { Add } from '@carbon/react/icons';\n\n<ComponentDemo\n  scope={{ Add }}\n  components={[\n    {\n      id: 'button',\n      label: 'Button',\n    },\n    {\n      id: 'button-with-icon',\n      label: 'Button with icon',\n    },\n    {\n      id: 'icon-only',\n      label: 'Icon only',\n    },\n  ]}\n>\n  <ComponentVariant\n    id=\"button\"\n    knobs={{\n      Button: ['kind', 'disabled', 'size'],\n    }}\n    links={{\n      React:\n        'https://react.carbondesignsystem.com/?path=/story/components-button--default',\n      Angular:\n        'https://angular.carbondesignsystem.com/?path=/story/components-button--basic',\n      Vue: 'http://vue.carbondesignsystem.com/?path=/story/components-cvbutton--default',\n      'Web Components':\n        'https://web-components.carbondesignsystem.com/?path=/story/components-button--default',\n    }}\n  >{`\n      <Button>Button</Button>\n    `}</ComponentVariant>\n  <ComponentVariant\n    id=\"button-with-icon\"\n    knobs={{\n      Button: ['kind', 'disabled', 'size'],\n    }}\n    links={{\n      React:\n        'https://react.carbondesignsystem.com/?path=/story/components-button--default',\n      Angular:\n        'https://angular.carbondesignsystem.com/?path=/story/components-button--basic',\n      Vue: 'http://vue.carbondesignsystem.com/?path=/story/components-cvbutton--default',\n      'Web Components':\n        'https://web-components.carbondesignsystem.com/?path=/story/components-button--default',\n    }}\n  >{`\n      <Button renderIcon={Add}>Button</Button>\n    `}</ComponentVariant>\n  <ComponentVariant\n    id=\"icon-only\"\n    knobs={{}}\n    links={{\n      React:\n        'https://react.carbondesignsystem.com/?path=/story/components-button--icon-button',\n      Angular:\n        'https://angular.carbondesignsystem.com/?path=/story/components-button--basic',\n      Vue: 'http://vue.carbondesignsystem.com/?path=/story/components-cvbutton--icon-only',\n      'Web Components':\n        'https://web-components.carbondesignsystem.com/?path=/story/components-button--icon',\n    }}\n  >{`\n     <IconButton align='top' label='Icon button' className='cds--btn--icon-only'>\n       <Add size={16}/>\n     </IconButton>\n  `}</ComponentVariant>\n</ComponentDemo>\n\n## Formatting\n\n### Anatomy\n\nA button’s text label is the most important element on a button, as it\ncommunicates the action that will be performed when the user interacts with it.\nIn a contained button the text is always left-aligned, not centered. By default\nCarbon uses sentence case for all button labels.\n\nIf a text label is not used, an icon should be present to signify what the\nbutton does.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Button anatomy](images/button_usage_2.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n<Row>\n<Column colSm={2} colMd={4} colLg={4}>\n\n#### 1.

The table below adds more context around the use case for each\nsize. For guidance on button heights as well as type sizes and tokens, see\n[Sizes](/components/button/style#sizes.mdx) on the Style tab.\n\n| Button size        | Use case                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Small              | Use when there is not enough vertical space for the default or field-sized button.                                                                                                                                                                       |\n| Medium             | Use when buttons are paired with input fields.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n| Large (productive) | This is the most common button size. Use 14px body copy.                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n| Large (expressive) | The larger expressive type size within this button provides balance when used with 16px body copy. Used by the IBM.com team in website banners.                                                                                                          |\n| Extra large        | Use when buttons bleed to the edge of a larger component, like side panels or modals. _Note: This variant is not offered in the kit because it does not have a coded counterpart.

For example, you don’t always need to use the secondary button as the\nsecond button in your layout. The most important thing is to establish a visual\nhierarchy between the buttons in your UI. Keep these best practices in mind.\n\n#### A single, high-emphasis button\n\nAs a general rule, a layout should contain a single high-emphasis button that\nmakes it clear that other buttons have less importance in the hierarchy. This\nhigh-emphasis button commands the most attention.\n\n#### Multiple button emphasis\n\nA high-emphasis button can be accompanied by medium- and low-emphasis buttons\nthat perform less important actions. Keep in mind that you should only group\ntogether calls to action that have a relationship to one another.\n\nAlthough secondary buttons have less visual prominence because they are less\nsaturated than their primary counterparts, they are still tonally heavy. If your\nlayout requires multiple actions—as is the case with some toolbars, data lists\nand dashboards—low emphasis buttons (tertiary or ghost) may be a better choice.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Button emphasis](images/button_usage_7.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n<DoDontRow>\n  <DoDont caption=\"Do use high-emphasis and medium-emphasis buttons in a button group.\">\n\n![Do use high-emphasis and medium-emphasis buttons in a button group.](images/button_usage_8_test.png)\n\n  </DoDont>\n  <DoDont type=\"dont\" caption=\"Do not use two high-emphasis buttons in a button group.\">\n\n![Do not use two high-emphasis buttons in a button group.](images/button_usage_9_test.png)\n\n  </DoDont>\n</DoDontRow>\n\n### Alignment\n\nAlignment refers to whether the buttons are aligned to the right or the left of\na window, container, or layout. Buttons are unique, more so than any other\ncomponent, in that their alignment depends on where they appear and whether or\nnot they’re contained within another component.\n\nAs a general rule, on full-page designs, the primary button is on the left side\nof the page. When the browser window is large and the user is scrolling to read,\nit’s best to have the primary button where the user’s attention has been focused\nall along. Whereas in wizards, where a user is progressing through a series of\nsteps or dialog windows, the primary action traditionally sits at the bottom\nright. Buttons within components such as notifications, search fields, and data\ntables are also right-aligned.\n\nIn some cases a button group—or even a single button in the case of a side panel\nor small tile—may span the entire width of a window or container. Typical nested\nbutton locations include:\n\n- Banner calls to action\n- Dialog windows\n- Wizards\n- Forms\n- Cards\n- Toolbars\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Primary button context](images/button_usage_10.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n| Alignment         | Use case                                                                                                                                                        |\n| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| _Left-justified_  | Banner call to actions, in-page forms, and nested buttons in components like tiles                                                                              |\n| _Right-justified_ | Inline notifications, inline field buttons and data tables, progressive forms, wizards, and single-button dialogs                                               |\n| _Full-span_       | Dialogs, side panels, and small tiles; currently Carbon does not offer a way to implement full-span buttons in code, without an override, they max out at 320px |\n\n#### Fluid versus fixed buttons\n\nButton alignment is also closely related to whether the button is treated as a\nfixed or a fluid element within a layout. When we say “fluid”, we mean that the\nbutton becomes a part of a larger, compound component by bleeding to two or more\nedges of its container. Rather than defining the a fluid button’s width in\ncolumns or mini units, its width is defined as a percentage (often 50%) of the\ncontainer’s width. Also, as a general rule, fluid buttons are never left-aligned\nin a layout or a container—they’re always either right-aligned, or span the full\nwidth of the container.\n\nFluid components like button never exist in isolation. As you can see in the\nexamples above, they are always part of another component, like modal or form.\nOther fluid components include tiles and most recently,\n[text inputs](/components/text-input/usage).\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Example of a fluid input field and fluid button](images/button_usage_11.png)\n\n<Caption>\n  Example of a login screen using a fluid input field and a fluid button\n</Caption>\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n<DoDontRow>\n  <DoDont caption=\"Do bleed ghost button hovers when they are paired with other fluid buttons.\">\n\n![Do bleed ghost button hovers when they are paired with other fluid buttons.](images/button_usage_12.png)\n\n  </DoDont>\n  <DoDont type=\"dont\" caption=\"Do not use a tertiary button in a fluid application.\">\n\n![Do not use a tertiary button in a fluid application.](images/button_usage_13.png)\n\n  </DoDont>\n</DoDontRow>\n\n#### Fluid button border\n\nMany product designers have approached us looking for more guidance around\nborders between all fluid buttons. There is a 1px border between all fluid\nbuttons that call the `$button-separator` token for borders. This feature adds a\n3:1 distinction between the two interactive UI elements. The border is a\nrecommended feature to improve accessibility.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Example of $button-separator token border between fluid buttons](images/button_usage_14.png)\n\n<Caption>\n  Example of $button-separator token border between fluid buttons\n</Caption>\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n#### Using the grid\n\nBy default the container’s width is set to the size of the text label with 64px\nfixed padding on the right side and 16px fixed padding on the left. However,\nwhen possible set the button container’s relative position to the responsive\nlayout grid and match button width to the other elements on the page. Ideally,\nwhen using groups of related buttons (not including ghost buttons), they should\nall be the same width. See [button groups](#Button-groups) below for more\ndetailed information.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Example of a primary button matching the width of a card in a layout](images/button_usage_15_test.png)\n\n<Caption>\n  Example of a primary button matching the width of a card in a layout\n</Caption>\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n### Button groups\n\nButton groups are a useful way of aligning buttons that have a relationship.\nGroup the buttons logically into sets based on usage and importance. Too many\ncalls to action will overwhelm and confuse users so they should be avoided.\n\nAs mentioned in the [Emphasis section](#Emphasis), you don’t necessarily need to\nuse the buttons in the order that their labels imply. Either a secondary or a\ntertiary button can be used in conjunction with a primary button. In fact, due\nto the visual weight of the secondary button, it’s recommended to use tertiary\nor ghost buttons in layouts with more than three calls to action.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![multiple buttons in a layout](images/button_usage_16.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n<DoDontRow>\n  <DoDont caption=\"Do use a primary and two of the same lower emphasis buttons in a button group.\">\n\n![Do use a primary and two of the same lower emphasis buttons in a button group.](images/button_usage_17.png)\n\n  </DoDont>\n  <DoDont type=\"dont\" caption=\"Do not mix primary, secondary, and tertiary buttons in the same button group.\">\n\n![Do not mix primary, secondary, and tertiary buttons in the same button group.](images/button_usage_18.png)\n\n  </DoDont>\n</DoDontRow>\n\n#### Button groups and the grid\n\nIdeally, when using groups of related buttons (not including ghost buttons),\nthey should all be the same width. This can be achieved in one of two ways, both\nof which are acceptable. The first approach involves using the\n[narrow grid mode](/guidelines/2x-grid/implementation#grid-modes). In this\nsituation each button would be set individually on the column grid. _Note:\nCarbon developers are working on the narrow grid mode, currently left-hanging\nbuttons can only be achieved with an override._\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Example of hanging buttons on the grid](images/button_usage_19.png)\n\n<Caption>Example of hanging buttons</Caption>\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\nSome products don’t want to hang their buttons into the gutter, but still want a\n16px distance between buttons. This can be achieved while maintaining same-width\nbuttons by treating the button group as a single object (rather than two\nseparate entities) on the grid. Each button will essentially span 50% of their\ncontainer with a programmatic 16px gutter between them.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Button group as single grid element](images/button_usage_20.png)\n\n<Caption>\n  Here the button group is treated as one element on the grid to achieve a 16px\n  gutter between the two, without gutter hang.\n</Caption>\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n<DoDontRow>\n  <DoDont caption=\"Do apply the same width to all buttons in a group, even if they don’t bleed.\">\n\n![Do apply the same width to all buttons in a group](images/button_usage_21.png)\n\n  </DoDont>\n  <DoDont type=\"dont\" caption=\"Do not make buttons in a group different widths.\">\n\n![Do not make buttons in a group different widths.](images/button_usage_22.png)\n\n  </DoDont>\n</DoDontRow>\n\n#### Horizontally arranged groups\n\nWhen using multiple buttons, the position of the primary button adheres to the\n[alignment guidance](#Alignment) above. To sum up, a primary button will be\nleft-aligned and positioned to the left of the secondary/tertiary button on\nfull-page designs. The primary button will be right-aligned and appear to the\nright of the secondary/tertiary button within wizards and dialog windows.\n\n<InlineNotification>\n\n**Note:** This guidance has changed. Previously we advocated maintaining the\nprimary button position to the right of the secondary button when the button\ngroup was left-aligned. After talking to teams and doing more research, we’ve\nrevised our position.\n\n</InlineNotification>\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Button groups in context](images/button_usage_23.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n#### Stacked button groups\n\nTypical landing pages for product have buttons side by side. However vertical\nbutton groups are also common in products, to save real estate in narrow columns\nand occasionally side panels. In these instances, the primary button is always\non top and the secondary or tertiary button is below.\n\nGenerally, when designers stack buttons, they tend to use the fixed buttons.\nHowever, stacked fluid buttons are also an option in desktop side panels with\nespecially long calls to action. _Note: experimenting with stacked fluid buttons\nwould require an override to the existing code._\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={12}>\n\n![Fluid and fixed stacked button group examples](images/button_usage_24.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n#### Groups with Danger buttons\n\nDanger buttons have a different visual style to inform users of potentially\ndestructive actions they are about to take. Within a set, use the primary danger\nbutton style.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Danger button treated as Primary button in a modal](images/button_usage_25.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n## Content\n\n### Text labels\n\nA button’s text label is the most important element on a button, as it\ncommunicates the action that will be performed when the user interacts with it.\nButtons need to be clear and predictable.\n\nButton labels should clearly indicate the action of the button. To provide\nenough context, use the {verb} + {noun} content formula on buttons except in the\ncase of common actions like “Done”, “Close”, “Cancel”, “Add”, or “Delete”.\n\nThere are exceptions to this rule for situations in which button length could\ncause problems in compact UIs or negatively impact translation, but the {verb} +\n{noun} formula is still best practice.\n\nFor consistency, see Carbon’s\n[content guidelines](/guidelines/content/action-labels) for a list of\nrecommended action labels.\n\n<DoDontRow>\n  <DoDont caption=\"Do use the {verb} + {noun} content formula in buttons whenever possible.\">\n\n![Do use the verb + noun content formula in buttons whenever possible](images/button_usage_26.png)\n\n  </DoDont>\n  <DoDont type=\"dont\" caption=\"Do not use only a noun as a button label.\">\n\n![Do not use only a noun as a button label](images/button_usage_27.png)\n\n  </DoDont>\n</DoDontRow>\n\n## Behaviors\n\n### Primary button\n\nThe Primary button is the default action. When dialogs appear, the primary\nbutton typically takes focus. On a form, if focus is on a component that is not\nactionable with the `Enter` key, pressing `Enter` will activate the primary\nbutton.\n\n### Interactions\n\n#### Mouse\n\nUsers can trigger a button by clicking anywhere within the button container.\n\n#### Keyboard\n\nUsers can trigger a button by pressing `Enter` or `Space` while the button has\nfocus. For additional keyboard interactions, see the\n[accessibility tab](/components/button/accessibility).\n\n## Modifiers\n\n### Buttons with icons\n\nIcons can be placed next to labels to both clarify an action and call attention\nto a button. There are certain instances where an icon will suffice in place of\na text label, but use icon buttons cautiously.\n\n- Use 16px glyphs within buttons; use 20px glyphs within the large expressive\n  buttons\n- Glyphs are distinguished by their solid shape and knocked-out details\n- Glyphs should always appear to the right of the text\n- Glyphs used in buttons must be directly related to the action that the user is\n  taking\n- Glyphs must be the same color value as the text within a button\n\n<DoDontRow>\n  <DoDont caption=\"Do place the icon on the right side of the button after the text.\">\n\n![Do place the icon on the right side of the button after the text](images/button_usage_28.png)\n\n  </DoDont>\n  <DoDont type=\"dont\" caption=\"Do not place the icon on the left side of the button before the text.\">\n\n![Do not place the icon on the left side of the button before the text](images/button_usage_29.png)\n\n  </DoDont>\n</DoDontRow>\n\n### Icon-only buttons\n\nIcon buttons allow users to take actions, and make choices, with a single tap.\nIcon buttons can take the form of a primary, secondary, tertiary, or ghost\nvariant but most commonly will be styled as primary or ghost buttons.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Example of an icon-only ghost button in a data table](images/button_usage_30.png)\n\n<Caption>Example of an icon-only ghost button in a data table</Caption>\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n### Danger button variations\n\nThe danger button has three different styles: primary, tertiary, and ghost.\nDetermining which danger button style to use will depend on the level of\nemphasis you want to give to the danger action. Destructive actions that are\nconsidered a required or primary step in a workflow should use the primary\ndanger button style. However, if a destructive action is just one of several\nactions a user could choose from, then a lower emphasis style like the tertiary\ndanger button or the ghost danger button may be more appropriate.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Danger button variations](images/button_usage_31.png)\n\n<Caption>Examples of the primary, tertiary, and ghost danger buttons</Caption>\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n## Related\n\n- [Link component](/components/link/usage)\n- [Modal component](/components/modal/usage)\n- [Form pattern](/patterns/forms-pattern)\n\n## References\n\n- Mehmet Goktürk,\n  [_The Glossary of Human Computer Interaction, Chapter 37_](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/book/the-glossary-of-human-computer-interaction/fitts-s-law)\n  (The Interaction Design Foundation)\n- Jakob Nielsen,\n  [_OK-Cancel or Cancel-OK?

They\ncommunicate calls to action to the user and allow users to interact with pages\nin a variety of ways. Button labels express what action will occur when the user\ninteracts with it.\n\n#### When to use\n\nUse buttons to communicate actions users can take and to allow users to interact\nwith the page. Each page should have only one primary button, and any remaining\ncalls to action should be represented as lower emphasis buttons.\n\n#### When not to use\n\nDo not use buttons as navigational elements. Instead, use\n[links](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/link/usage) when the\ndesired action is to take the user to a new page.\n\n### Button variants\n\nEach button variant has a particular function and its design signals that\nfunction to the user. It is therefore very important that the different variants\nare implemented consistently across products, so that they message the correct\nactions.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={12}>\n\n![Button variants](images/button_usage_1.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n| Variant     | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |\n| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| _Primary_   | For the principal call to action on the page. Primary buttons should only appear once per screen (not including the application header, modal dialog, or side panel).                                                                                                                                                                         |\n| _Secondary_ | For secondary actions on each page. Secondary buttons can only be used in conjunction with a primary button. As part of a pair, the secondary button's function is to perform the negative action of the set, such as \"Cancel\" or \"Back\". Do not use a secondary button in isolation and do not use a secondary button for a positive action. |\n| _Tertiary_  | For less prominent, and sometimes independent, actions. Tertiary buttons can be used in isolation or paired with a primary button when there are multiple calls to action. Tertiary buttons can also be used for sub-tasks on a page where a primary button for the main and final action is present.                                         |\n| _Danger_    | For actions that could have destructive effects on the user’s data (for example, delete or remove). Danger button has three styles: primary, tertiary, and ghost.                                                                                                                                                                             |\n| _Ghost_     | For the least pronounced actions; often used in conjunction with a primary button. In a situation such as a progress flow, a ghost button may be paired with a primary and secondary button set, where the primary button is for forward action, the secondary button is for \"Back\", and the ghost button is for \"Cancel\".                    |\n\n## Live demo\n\nimport { Add } from '@carbon/react/icons';\n\n<ComponentDemo\n  scope={{ Add }}\n  components={[\n    {\n      id: 'button',\n      label: 'Button',\n    },\n    {\n      id: 'button-with-icon',\n      label: 'Button with icon',\n    },\n    {\n      id: 'icon-only',\n      label: 'Icon only',\n    },\n  ]}\n>\n  <ComponentVariant\n    id=\"button\"\n    knobs={{\n      Button: ['kind', 'disabled', 'size'],\n    }}\n    links={{\n      React:\n        'https://react.carbondesignsystem.com/?path=/story/components-button--default',\n      Angular:\n        'https://angular.carbondesignsystem.com/?path=/story/components-button--basic',\n      Vue: 'http://vue.carbondesignsystem.com/?path=/story/components-cvbutton--default',\n      'Web Components':\n        'https://web-components.carbondesignsystem.com/?path=/story/components-button--default',\n    }}\n  >{`\n      <Button>Button</Button>\n    `}</ComponentVariant>\n  <ComponentVariant\n    id=\"button-with-icon\"\n    knobs={{\n      Button: ['kind', 'disabled', 'size'],\n    }}\n    links={{\n      React:\n        'https://react.carbondesignsystem.com/?path=/story/components-button--default',\n      Angular:\n        'https://angular.carbondesignsystem.com/?path=/story/components-button--basic',\n      Vue: 'http://vue.carbondesignsystem.com/?path=/story/components-cvbutton--default',\n      'Web Components':\n        'https://web-components.carbondesignsystem.com/?path=/story/components-button--default',\n    }}\n  >{`\n      <Button renderIcon={Add}>Button</Button>\n    `}</ComponentVariant>\n  <ComponentVariant\n    id=\"icon-only\"\n    knobs={{}}\n    links={{\n      React:\n        'https://react.carbondesignsystem.com/?path=/story/components-button--icon-button',\n      Angular:\n        'https://angular.carbondesignsystem.com/?path=/story/components-button--basic',\n      Vue: 'http://vue.carbondesignsystem.com/?path=/story/components-cvbutton--icon-only',\n      'Web Components':\n        'https://web-components.carbondesignsystem.com/?path=/story/components-button--icon',\n    }}\n  >{`\n     <IconButton align='top' label='Icon button' className='cds--btn--icon-only'>\n       <Add size={16}/>\n     </IconButton>\n  `}</ComponentVariant>\n</ComponentDemo>\n\n## Formatting\n\n### Anatomy\n\nA button’s text label is the most important element on a button, as it\ncommunicates the action that will be performed when the user interacts with it.\nIn a contained button the text is always left-aligned, not centered. By default\nCarbon uses sentence case for all button labels.\n\nIf a text label is not used, an icon should be present to signify what the\nbutton does.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Button anatomy](images/button_usage_2.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n<Row>\n<Column colSm={2} colMd={4} colLg={4}>\n\n#### 1.

The table below adds more context around the use case for each\nsize. For guidance on button heights as well as type sizes and tokens, see\n[Sizes](/components/button/style#sizes.mdx) on the Style tab.\n\n| Button size        | Use case                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| Small              | Use when there is not enough vertical space for the default or field-sized button.                                                                                                                                                                       |\n| Medium             | Use when buttons are paired with input fields.                                                                                                                                                                                                           |\n| Large (productive) | This is the most common button size. Use 14px body copy.                                                                                                                                                                                                 |\n| Large (expressive) | The larger expressive type size within this button provides balance when used with 16px body copy. Used by the IBM.com team in website banners.                                                                                                          |\n| Extra large        | Use when buttons bleed to the edge of a larger component, like side panels or modals. _Note: This variant is not offered in the kit because it does not have a coded counterpart.

For example, you don’t always need to use the secondary button as the\nsecond button in your layout. The most important thing is to establish a visual\nhierarchy between the buttons in your UI. Keep these best practices in mind.\n\n#### A single, high-emphasis button\n\nAs a general rule, a layout should contain a single high-emphasis button that\nmakes it clear that other buttons have less importance in the hierarchy. This\nhigh-emphasis button commands the most attention.\n\n#### Multiple button emphasis\n\nA high-emphasis button can be accompanied by medium- and low-emphasis buttons\nthat perform less important actions. Keep in mind that you should only group\ntogether calls to action that have a relationship to one another.\n\nAlthough secondary buttons have less visual prominence because they are less\nsaturated than their primary counterparts, they are still tonally heavy. If your\nlayout requires multiple actions—as is the case with some toolbars, data lists\nand dashboards—low emphasis buttons (tertiary or ghost) may be a better choice.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Button emphasis](images/button_usage_7.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n<DoDontRow>\n  <DoDont caption=\"Do use high-emphasis and medium-emphasis buttons in a button group.\">\n\n![Do use high-emphasis and medium-emphasis buttons in a button group.](images/button_usage_8_test.png)\n\n  </DoDont>\n  <DoDont type=\"dont\" caption=\"Do not use two high-emphasis buttons in a button group.\">\n\n![Do not use two high-emphasis buttons in a button group.](images/button_usage_9_test.png)\n\n  </DoDont>\n</DoDontRow>\n\n### Alignment\n\nAlignment refers to whether the buttons are aligned to the right or the left of\na window, container, or layout. Buttons are unique, more so than any other\ncomponent, in that their alignment depends on where they appear and whether or\nnot they’re contained within another component.\n\nAs a general rule, on full-page designs, the primary button is on the left side\nof the page. When the browser window is large and the user is scrolling to read,\nit’s best to have the primary button where the user’s attention has been focused\nall along. Whereas in wizards, where a user is progressing through a series of\nsteps or dialog windows, the primary action traditionally sits at the bottom\nright. Buttons within components such as notifications, search fields, and data\ntables are also right-aligned.\n\nIn some cases a button group—or even a single button in the case of a side panel\nor small tile—may span the entire width of a window or container. Typical nested\nbutton locations include:\n\n- Banner calls to action\n- Dialog windows\n- Wizards\n- Forms\n- Cards\n- Toolbars\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Primary button context](images/button_usage_10.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n| Alignment         | Use case                                                                                                                                                        |\n| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| _Left-justified_  | Banner call to actions, in-page forms, and nested buttons in components like tiles                                                                              |\n| _Right-justified_ | Inline notifications, inline field buttons and data tables, progressive forms, wizards, and single-button dialogs                                               |\n| _Full-span_       | Dialogs, side panels, and small tiles; currently Carbon does not offer a way to implement full-span buttons in code, without an override, they max out at 320px |\n\n#### Fluid versus fixed buttons\n\nButton alignment is also closely related to whether the button is treated as a\nfixed or a fluid element within a layout. When we say “fluid”, we mean that the\nbutton becomes a part of a larger, compound component by bleeding to two or more\nedges of its container. Rather than defining the a fluid button’s width in\ncolumns or mini units, its width is defined as a percentage (often 50%) of the\ncontainer’s width. Also, as a general rule, fluid buttons are never left-aligned\nin a layout or a container—they’re always either right-aligned, or span the full\nwidth of the container.\n\nFluid components like button never exist in isolation. As you can see in the\nexamples above, they are always part of another component, like modal or form.\nOther fluid components include tiles and most recently,\n[text inputs](/components/text-input/usage).\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Example of a fluid input field and fluid button](images/button_usage_11.png)\n\n<Caption>\n  Example of a login screen using a fluid input field and a fluid button\n</Caption>\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n<DoDontRow>\n  <DoDont caption=\"Do bleed ghost button hovers when they are paired with other fluid buttons.\">\n\n![Do bleed ghost button hovers when they are paired with other fluid buttons.](images/button_usage_12.png)\n\n  </DoDont>\n  <DoDont type=\"dont\" caption=\"Do not use a tertiary button in a fluid application.\">\n\n![Do not use a tertiary button in a fluid application.](images/button_usage_13.png)\n\n  </DoDont>\n</DoDontRow>\n\n#### Fluid button border\n\nMany product designers have approached us looking for more guidance around\nborders between all fluid buttons. There is a 1px border between all fluid\nbuttons that call the `$button-separator` token for borders. This feature adds a\n3:1 distinction between the two interactive UI elements. The border is a\nrecommended feature to improve accessibility.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Example of $button-separator token border between fluid buttons](images/button_usage_14.png)\n\n<Caption>\n  Example of $button-separator token border between fluid buttons\n</Caption>\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n#### Using the grid\n\nBy default the container’s width is set to the size of the text label with 64px\nfixed padding on the right side and 16px fixed padding on the left. However,\nwhen possible set the button container’s relative position to the responsive\nlayout grid and match button width to the other elements on the page. Ideally,\nwhen using groups of related buttons (not including ghost buttons), they should\nall be the same width. See [button groups](#Button-groups) below for more\ndetailed information.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Example of a primary button matching the width of a card in a layout](images/button_usage_15_test.png)\n\n<Caption>\n  Example of a primary button matching the width of a card in a layout\n</Caption>\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n### Button groups\n\nButton groups are a useful way of aligning buttons that have a relationship.\nGroup the buttons logically into sets based on usage and importance. Too many\ncalls to action will overwhelm and confuse users so they should be avoided.\n\nAs mentioned in the [Emphasis section](#Emphasis), you don’t necessarily need to\nuse the buttons in the order that their labels imply. Either a secondary or a\ntertiary button can be used in conjunction with a primary button. In fact, due\nto the visual weight of the secondary button, it’s recommended to use tertiary\nor ghost buttons in layouts with more than three calls to action.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![multiple buttons in a layout](images/button_usage_16.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n<DoDontRow>\n  <DoDont caption=\"Do use a primary and two of the same lower emphasis buttons in a button group.\">\n\n![Do use a primary and two of the same lower emphasis buttons in a button group.](images/button_usage_17.png)\n\n  </DoDont>\n  <DoDont type=\"dont\" caption=\"Do not mix primary, secondary, and tertiary buttons in the same button group.\">\n\n![Do not mix primary, secondary, and tertiary buttons in the same button group.](images/button_usage_18.png)\n\n  </DoDont>\n</DoDontRow>\n\n#### Button groups and the grid\n\nIdeally, when using groups of related buttons (not including ghost buttons),\nthey should all be the same width. This can be achieved in one of two ways, both\nof which are acceptable. The first approach involves using the\n[narrow grid mode](/guidelines/2x-grid/implementation#grid-modes). In this\nsituation each button would be set individually on the column grid. _Note:\nCarbon developers are working on the narrow grid mode, currently left-hanging\nbuttons can only be achieved with an override._\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Example of hanging buttons on the grid](images/button_usage_19.png)\n\n<Caption>Example of hanging buttons</Caption>\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\nSome products don’t want to hang their buttons into the gutter, but still want a\n16px distance between buttons. This can be achieved while maintaining same-width\nbuttons by treating the button group as a single object (rather than two\nseparate entities) on the grid. Each button will essentially span 50% of their\ncontainer with a programmatic 16px gutter between them.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Button group as single grid element](images/button_usage_20.png)\n\n<Caption>\n  Here the button group is treated as one element on the grid to achieve a 16px\n  gutter between the two, without gutter hang.\n</Caption>\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n<DoDontRow>\n  <DoDont caption=\"Do apply the same width to all buttons in a group, even if they don’t bleed.\">\n\n![Do apply the same width to all buttons in a group](images/button_usage_21.png)\n\n  </DoDont>\n  <DoDont type=\"dont\" caption=\"Do not make buttons in a group different widths.\">\n\n![Do not make buttons in a group different widths.](images/button_usage_22.png)\n\n  </DoDont>\n</DoDontRow>\n\n#### Horizontally arranged groups\n\nWhen using multiple buttons, the position of the primary button adheres to the\n[alignment guidance](#Alignment) above. To sum up, a primary button will be\nleft-aligned and positioned to the left of the secondary/tertiary button on\nfull-page designs. The primary button will be right-aligned and appear to the\nright of the secondary/tertiary button within wizards and dialog windows.\n\n<InlineNotification>\n\n**Note:** This guidance has changed. Previously we advocated maintaining the\nprimary button position to the right of the secondary button when the button\ngroup was left-aligned. After talking to teams and doing more research, we’ve\nrevised our position.\n\n</InlineNotification>\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Button groups in context](images/button_usage_23.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n#### Stacked button groups\n\nTypical landing pages for product have buttons side by side. However vertical\nbutton groups are also common in products, to save real estate in narrow columns\nand occasionally side panels. In these instances, the primary button is always\non top and the secondary or tertiary button is below.\n\nGenerally, when designers stack buttons, they tend to use the fixed buttons.\nHowever, stacked fluid buttons are also an option in desktop side panels with\nespecially long calls to action. _Note: experimenting with stacked fluid buttons\nwould require an override to the existing code._\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={12}>\n\n![Fluid and fixed stacked button group examples](images/button_usage_24.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n#### Groups with Danger buttons\n\nDanger buttons have a different visual style to inform users of potentially\ndestructive actions they are about to take. Within a set, use the primary danger\nbutton style.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Danger button treated as Primary button in a modal](images/button_usage_25.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n## Content\n\n### Text labels\n\nA button’s text label is the most important element on a button, as it\ncommunicates the action that will be performed when the user interacts with it.\nButtons need to be clear and predictable.\n\nButton labels should clearly indicate the action of the button. To provide\nenough context, use the {verb} + {noun} content formula on buttons except in the\ncase of common actions like “Done”, “Close”, “Cancel”, “Add”, or “Delete”.\n\nThere are exceptions to this rule for situations in which button length could\ncause problems in compact UIs or negatively impact translation, but the {verb} +\n{noun} formula is still best practice.\n\nFor consistency, see Carbon’s\n[content guidelines](/guidelines/content/action-labels) for a list of\nrecommended action labels.\n\n<DoDontRow>\n  <DoDont caption=\"Do use the {verb} + {noun} content formula in buttons whenever possible.\">\n\n![Do use the verb + noun content formula in buttons whenever possible](images/button_usage_26.png)\n\n  </DoDont>\n  <DoDont type=\"dont\" caption=\"Do not use only a noun as a button label.\">\n\n![Do not use only a noun as a button label](images/button_usage_27.png)\n\n  </DoDont>\n</DoDontRow>\n\n## Behaviors\n\n### Primary button\n\nThe Primary button is the default action. When dialogs appear, the primary\nbutton typically takes focus. On a form, if focus is on a component that is not\nactionable with the `Enter` key, pressing `Enter` will activate the primary\nbutton.\n\n### Interactions\n\n#### Mouse\n\nUsers can trigger a button by clicking anywhere within the button container.\n\n#### Keyboard\n\nUsers can trigger a button by pressing `Enter` or `Space` while the button has\nfocus. For additional keyboard interactions, see the\n[accessibility tab](/components/button/accessibility).\n\n## Modifiers\n\n### Buttons with icons\n\nIcons can be placed next to labels to both clarify an action and call attention\nto a button. There are certain instances where an icon will suffice in place of\na text label, but use icon buttons cautiously.\n\n- Use 16px glyphs within buttons; use 20px glyphs within the large expressive\n  buttons\n- Glyphs are distinguished by their solid shape and knocked-out details\n- Glyphs should always appear to the right of the text\n- Glyphs used in buttons must be directly related to the action that the user is\n  taking\n- Glyphs must be the same color value as the text within a button\n\n<DoDontRow>\n  <DoDont caption=\"Do place the icon on the right side of the button after the text.\">\n\n![Do place the icon on the right side of the button after the text](images/button_usage_28.png)\n\n  </DoDont>\n  <DoDont type=\"dont\" caption=\"Do not place the icon on the left side of the button before the text.\">\n\n![Do not place the icon on the left side of the button before the text](images/button_usage_29.png)\n\n  </DoDont>\n</DoDontRow>\n\n### Icon-only buttons\n\nIcon buttons allow users to take actions, and make choices, with a single tap.\nIcon buttons can take the form of a primary, secondary, tertiary, or ghost\nvariant but most commonly will be styled as primary or ghost buttons.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Example of an icon-only ghost button in a data table](images/button_usage_30.png)\n\n<Caption>Example of an icon-only ghost button in a data table</Caption>\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n### Danger button variations\n\nThe danger button has three different styles: primary, tertiary, and ghost.\nDetermining which danger button style to use will depend on the level of\nemphasis you want to give to the danger action. Destructive actions that are\nconsidered a required or primary step in a workflow should use the primary\ndanger button style. However, if a destructive action is just one of several\nactions a user could choose from, then a lower emphasis style like the tertiary\ndanger button or the ghost danger button may be more appropriate.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Danger button variations](images/button_usage_31.png)\n\n<Caption>Examples of the primary, tertiary, and ghost danger buttons</Caption>\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n## Related\n\n- [Link component](/components/link/usage)\n- [Modal component](/components/modal/usage)\n- [Form pattern](/patterns/forms-pattern)\n\n## References\n\n- Mehmet Goktürk,\n  [_The Glossary of Human Computer Interaction, Chapter 37_](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/book/the-glossary-of-human-computer-interaction/fitts-s-law)\n  (The Interaction Design Foundation)\n- Jakob Nielsen,\n  [_OK-Cancel or Cancel-OK?
