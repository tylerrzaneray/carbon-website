The header title give the user a high level\noverview of the content allowing the user to decide which sections to read.\n\nAccordions can make information processing and discovering more effective.\nHowever, it does hide content from users and it's important to account for a\nuser not noticing or reading all of the included content. If a user is likely to\nread all of the content then don't use an accordion as it adds the burden of an\nextra click; instead use a full scrolling page with normal headers.\n\n### When to use:\n\n- To organize related information.\n- To shorten pages and reduce scrolling when content is not crucial to read in\n  full.\n- When space is at a premium and long content cannot be displayed all at once,\n  like on a mobile interface or in a side panel.\n\n## Live demo\n\n<ComponentDemo\n  components={[\n    {\n      id: 'accordion',\n      label: 'Accordion',\n    },\n  ]}\n>\n  <ComponentVariant\n    id=\"accordion\"\n    knobs={{\n      Accordion: ['align', 'disabled'],\n      AccordionItem: ['open', 'disabled'],\n    }}\n    links={{\n      React:\n        'https://react.carbondesignsystem.com/?path=/story/components-accordion--accordion',\n      Angular:\n        'https://angular.carbondesignsystem.com/?path=/story/components-accordion--basic',\n      Vue: 'http://vue.carbondesignsystem.com/?path=/story/components-cvaccordion--default',\n      'Web Components':\n        'https://web-components.carbondesignsystem.com/?path=/story/components-accordion--default',\n    }}\n  >\n    {`\n  <Accordion>\n    <AccordionItem title=\"Title 1\"><p>The accordion component delivers large amounts of content in a small space through progressive disclosure.

This\nallows for the title on the `start` side to align with other type elements in\nthe layout, which is the preferred alignment scenario.\n\nHowever, in some rare scenarios, the accordion may be modified to place the icon\nin `start` front of the title to function more like a tree. Most instances\nshould use the default `end` alignment, especially for any pure content or\ndocumentation purposes. Icon placement in accordions should be consistent\nthroughout your page and should not alternate.\n\n<DoDontRow>\n<DoDont\ncolMd={4} colLg={4}\ncaption=\"In most cases, use the default end icon alignment to keep accordion text aligned with other content on the page.\">\n\n![Do use the default end icon alignment to keep accordion text aligned with other content on the page.](./images/accordion-alignment-do.png)\n\n</DoDont>\n<DoDont\ncolMd={4} colLg={4}\ncaption=\"In rare case, you can place icons on the start side for tree like functionality.\">\n\n![Do place icons on the start side for tree like functionality.](./images/accordion-alignment-do-2.png)\n\n</DoDont>\n</DoDontRow>\n\n### Placement\n\nAccordions can be placed with main page content or placed inside of a container\nsuch as a side panel or tile.\n\n<Row>\n<Column  colLg={12} colMd={12} colSm={4}>\n<ArtDirection>\n\n![accordion placement](images/accordion-placement-2m.png)\n![accordion placement](images/accordion-placement-2.png)\n![accordion placement](images/accordion-placement-2.png)\n\n</ArtDirection>\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n#### Grid placement\n\nWhen placing an accordion on the 2x Grid the indented title aligns to the grid\ncolumns and the top and bottom borders hang in the gutter.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![accordion grid placement](images/accordion-placement-1.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n## Content\n\n### Main elements\n\n#### Title\n\n- The title should be as brief as possible while still being clear and\n  descriptive.\n- Each title should be wrapped in a\n  [role heading](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/#wai-aria-roles-states-and-properties)\n  (h1-h6) that is appropriate for the information architecture of the page.\n\n#### Body copy\n\n- Content inside of a section may be split into paragraphs and include\n  sub-headers if needed.\n\n### Scrolling content\n\nWhen the accordion content is longer than the viewport the whole accordion\nshould vertically scroll. Content should not scroll inside of an individual\npanel. Content should never scroll horizontally in an accordion.\n\n## Behaviors\n\n### States\n\nThe accordion component has two main states: **collapsed** and **expanded**. The\nchevron icon at the end of the accordion indicates which state the accordion is\nin. The chevron points down to indicate collapsed and up to indicate expanded.\n\nAccordions begin by default in the collapsed state with all content panels\nclosed.
