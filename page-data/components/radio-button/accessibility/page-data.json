Carbon incorporates many\nother accessibility considerations, some of which are described below.\n\n### Keyboard interaction\n\nA group of radio buttons takes a single tab stop. Carbon requires an item to be\nselected by default, and this item will always take focus. The user changes the\nselected radio button using the arrow keys (up/down or left/right). Pressing\n`Tab` again will move focus out of the radio button group to the next component.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![example of tabbing into a radio button group and arrowing between selections](images/radio-button-accessibility-1.png)\n\n<Caption>\n  A radio button group is a single tab stop and radio buttons are selected using\n  arrow keys.\n</Caption>\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n### Labeling and states\n\nCarbon surfaces the labeling of radio buttons and groups to screen readers and\nother assistive technologies.
