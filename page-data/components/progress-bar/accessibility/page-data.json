For example, if\na progress bar is being used to upload a file, the Upload button is disabled\nuntil the progress bar state changes to either error or completed.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![example of Upload file button in disabled state while the Uploading file progress bar is active](images/progress-bar-accessibility-1.png)\n\n<Caption>\n  Progress bars are not interactive, but may temporarily disable dependent\n  components.\n</Caption>\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n### Labelling and states\n\nThe label above the progress bar as well as the optional helper text below it\nare surfaced to assistive technologies.
