They always contain at least two items and one\ntab is active at a time. Tabs can be used on full page layouts or in components\nsuch as modals, cards, or side panels.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={12}>\n\n![An example of tabs being used.](images/tabs-usage-1.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n### When to use\n\n- Use tabs to group related information into different categories, helping to\n  reduce cognitive load.\n- Tabs can be used to organize content such as forms, settings, and dashboards\n  so a user does not have to navigate away from their workflow to complete their\n  task.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![tab thumbnail.](images/tab-usage-2.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n### When not to use\n\n- Tabs should never be used for primary navigation. If tabs become too complex,\n  consider using a standard navigation pattern.\n- Tabs should not be used to indicate progress. Use the progress indicator\n  instead.\n- Tabs should not be used if the user is comparing information in two groups, as\n  this would result in the user having to click back and forth to complete a\n  task.\n\n### Variants\n\n| Variant     | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                                   |\n| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| _Line_      | A standalone tab that can also be nested within components.

Container\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n### Alignment\n\nMuch like\n[buttons](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/button/usage/#alignment),\nalignment of tabs depends on where they appear and whether or not they're\ncontained within another component. As a general rule, the first label for both\nline tabs and contained tabs align with the grid and the text below. If tabs are\nwithin another component, such as a card, follow the grid that you are using\ninside the component and align the label with text in the component.\n\n<DoDontRow>\n  <DoDont caption=\"Do align tab labels with the grid\">\n\n![Do align tab labels with the grid](images/tab-usage-6-do.png)\n\n  </DoDont>\n  <DoDont type=\"dont\" caption=\"Do not align tab container with the grid\">\n\n![Do not align tab container with the grid](images/tab-usage-6-dont.png)\n\n  </DoDont>\n</DoDontRow>\n\n#### Auto-width\n\nWith both line tabs and contained tabs, auto-width is the default behavior. Each\ntab will be a different size depending on the label's character count but will\nhave consistent padding on each side of the label. The first label, selected by\ndefault, should align to the grid. Where the tabs end will vary and may not end\non the grid. If needed, you may also use a line to help balance tabs with other\ncomponents on the page.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={12}>\n\n![Autowidth tabs](images/tab-usage-7.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n<Caption>Example of auto-width line tabs using a rule</Caption>\n\n#### Aligning to grid columns\n\nInstead of using the default auto-width behavior, contained tabs also have the\noption to align to the grid. As a group, the tabs span a set of columns with\neach tab being equal in size. The first tab’s label should align to the first\ncolumn you are using with the last tab in the group always ending at a column’s\nedge. The tabs in between will flow accordingly and may or may not align to the\ngrid but will always be the same size.\n\nUse the\n[2x grid](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/guidelines/2x-grid/overview#2x-grid-fundamentals)\nto drive visual rhythm by spacing content in multiples of two columns and\naligning the beginning and ending of the tab elements with content below the\ntabs when possible.\n\n<InlineNotification>\n  _Note: This is not currently implemented in the components, updates for\n  alignment to the grid are incoming!_\n</InlineNotification>\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={12}>\n\n![Aligning to grid columns](images/tab-usage-8.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n<Caption>Example of contained tabs using the grid</Caption>\n\n#### Alignment within a component\n\nWhen using line tabs within a component (like a modal) the first label should\nalways align to the other content in the space. Do not use contained tabs. The\nedges of the line tab may also bleed to the edges of the space if needed\ndepending on the container's margins. To add hierarchical clarity and balance\nthe tabs with the other content, a line may be added from the end of the last\ntab to the edge of the content area.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Contained tabs within a component](images/tab-usage-9.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n<Caption>Aligning tabs within a component</Caption>\n\n## Content\n\n### Main elements\n\n#### Labels\n\n- Use short tab labels that are clear and specific. Labels should be one to two\n  words, as these are easier to scan.\n- Text labels should clearly communicate the view users will see and the content\n  contained in the view.\n\n#### Secondary labels\n\n- Contained tabs can have secondary labels to add clarity or assist the user in\n  choosing the right selection.\n\n### Further guidance\n\nFor further content guidance, see Carbon's\n[content guidelines](/guidelines/content/overview).\n\n## Behaviors\n\n### States\n\nTabs allow for three states: **selected, unselected,** and **disabled**. The\ndefault view is that one tab is preselected and is usually the first tab. Only\none tab can be selected at a time. When a user chooses a new item, the previous\ntab is automatically deselected. If a user navigates away from a tab, a user\nshould return to the last tab selected.\n\nFor detailed visual information about the various states for this component, see\nthe [Style tab](https://carbondesignsystem.com/components/tabs/style).\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Tab states](images/tab-usage-10.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n<Caption>\n  Example of selected, unselected, and disabled states in line tabs (top) and\n  contained tabs (bottom)\n</Caption>\n\n### Scrollable\n\nWhen your page requires more tabs that can fit or needs to adapt to a new\nbrowser size, tabs should become scrollable. Left and right arrows appear to\nhelp navigate the user through tabs that might be off-page.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Scrollable tabs](images/tab-usage-11.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n<Caption>\n  Example of scrolling in line tabs (top) and contained tabs (bottom)\n</Caption>\n\n### Interactions\n\n#### Mouse\n\nUsers can trigger a state change by clicking anywhere in the container area.\n\n#### Keyboard\n\nOne tab should be selected by default. Users can navigate between tabs by\npressing right or left arrow keys. For additional keyboard interactions, see the\n[Accessibility tab](https://carbondesignsystem.com/components/tabs/accessibility).\n\n#### Screenreader\n\nVoiceOver: Users can navigate between tabs by pressing `right` or `left` arrow\nkeys.\n\nJAWS: Users can navigate between tabs by pressing `right` or `left` arrow keys.\n\nNVDA: Users can navigate between tabs by pressing `right` or `left` arrow keys.\n\nFor additional information, see the\n[Accessibility tab](https://carbondesignsystem.com/components/tabs/accessibility).\n\n## Modifiers\n\n### Tabs with icons\n\nYou may use icons in either line or contained tabs. Icons are always pinned to\nthe right of the tab and do not appear above, below, or to the left of the\nlabel.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Examples of tabs with icons](images/tab-usage-12.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n<Caption>\n  Note: Tabs with an icon is an example of a pattern. It is not currently\n  implemented by default in the component, it is instead enabled through the\n  composable component API. This requires additional styling and configuration.\n</Caption>\n\n### Icon-only tabs\n\nYou may use icon-only tabs with both line and contained tabs. Icons must be\neasily recognized and globally accepted. These work best in small, defined\nspaces and in components. Always use a tooltip for an icon description on hover\nto add clarity.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Example of icon-only tabs within a side panel](images/tab-usage-13.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n### Secondary labels\n\nContained tabs that align with the grid allow for a secondary label. Do not use\nsecondary labels with line tabs or auto-width contained tabs.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Example of tabs with a secondary label](images/tab-usage-14.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n<Caption>Note: The secondary label is an example of a pattern. It is not currently implemented in the component.</Caption>\n\n## Related\n\n#### Content switcher versus tabs\n\n[Content switchers](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/content-switcher/usage/)\nallow users to compare and toggle between alternate views of similar or related\ncontent. Content that is grouped into tabs is part of the same bigger context\nbut the content does not overlap.\n\n#### Navigation versus tabs\n\nTabs should not be used for common navigation patterns. If your tab arrangements\nare becoming too complex with different levels of content, consider using\n[left](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/UI-shell-left-panel/usage/)\nor\n[right](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/UI-shell-right-panel/usage/)\nUI panels, possibly in conjunction with breadcrumbs, to help the user through\nthe content.\n\n#### Progress indicator versus tabs\n\n[Progress indicator](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/progress-indicator/usage/)\ncontent moves in a logical progression, showing next steps to guide the user\nthrough the completion of a task. Tabs organize content into groups that the\nuser can navigate through; they do not support progressive tasks.\n\n## References\n\nJakob Nielson,\n[Tabs, Used Right](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/tabs-used-right/) (Nielsen\nNorman Group, 2016)\n\n## Feedback\n\nHelp us improve this component by providing feedback, asking questions, and\nleaving any other comments on\n[GitHub](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-website/issues/new?assignees=&labels=feedback&template=feedback.md).\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"7702385f71b64499d57c3b75ac55e423","owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx","counter":3977},"frontmatter":{"title":"Tabs","description":"Use tabs to allow users to navigate easily between views within the same context.","tabs":["Usage","Style","Code","Accessibility"]},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: Tabs\ndescription:\n  Use tabs to allow users to navigate easily between views within the same\n  context.\ntabs: ['Usage', 'Style', 'Code', 'Accessibility']\n---\n\nimport { Tabs, TabList, Tab, TabPanels, TabPanel } from '@carbon/react';\n\n<PageDescription>\n\nTabs are used to organize related content.

Labels should be one to two\n  words, as these are easier to scan.\n- Text labels should clearly communicate the view users will see and the content\n  contained in the view.\n\n#### Secondary labels\n\n- Contained tabs can have secondary labels to add clarity or assist the user in\n  choosing the right selection.\n\n### Further guidance\n\nFor further content guidance, see Carbon's\n[content guidelines](/guidelines/content/overview).\n\n## Behaviors\n\n### States\n\nTabs allow for three states: **selected, unselected,** and **disabled**. The\ndefault view is that one tab is preselected and is usually the first tab. Only\none tab can be selected at a time. When a user chooses a new item, the previous\ntab is automatically deselected. If a user navigates away from a tab, a user\nshould return to the last tab selected.\n\nFor detailed visual information about the various states for this component, see\nthe [Style tab](https://carbondesignsystem.com/components/tabs/style).\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Tab states](images/tab-usage-10.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n<Caption>\n  Example of selected, unselected, and disabled states in line tabs (top) and\n  contained tabs (bottom)\n</Caption>\n\n### Scrollable\n\nWhen your page requires more tabs that can fit or needs to adapt to a new\nbrowser size, tabs should become scrollable. Left and right arrows appear to\nhelp navigate the user through tabs that might be off-page.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Scrollable tabs](images/tab-usage-11.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n<Caption>\n  Example of scrolling in line tabs (top) and contained tabs (bottom)\n</Caption>\n\n### Interactions\n\n#### Mouse\n\nUsers can trigger a state change by clicking anywhere in the container area.\n\n#### Keyboard\n\nOne tab should be selected by default. Users can navigate between tabs by\npressing right or left arrow keys. For additional keyboard interactions, see the\n[Accessibility tab](https://carbondesignsystem.com/components/tabs/accessibility).\n\n#### Screenreader\n\nVoiceOver: Users can navigate between tabs by pressing `right` or `left` arrow\nkeys.\n\nJAWS: Users can navigate between tabs by pressing `right` or `left` arrow keys.\n\nNVDA: Users can navigate between tabs by pressing `right` or `left` arrow keys.\n\nFor additional information, see the\n[Accessibility tab](https://carbondesignsystem.com/components/tabs/accessibility).\n\n## Modifiers\n\n### Tabs with icons\n\nYou may use icons in either line or contained tabs. Icons are always pinned to\nthe right of the tab and do not appear above, below, or to the left of the\nlabel.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Examples of tabs with icons](images/tab-usage-12.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n<Caption>\n  Note: Tabs with an icon is an example of a pattern. It is not currently\n  implemented by default in the component, it is instead enabled through the\n  composable component API. This requires additional styling and configuration.\n</Caption>\n\n### Icon-only tabs\n\nYou may use icon-only tabs with both line and contained tabs. Icons must be\neasily recognized and globally accepted. These work best in small, defined\nspaces and in components. Always use a tooltip for an icon description on hover\nto add clarity.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Example of icon-only tabs within a side panel](images/tab-usage-13.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n### Secondary labels\n\nContained tabs that align with the grid allow for a secondary label. Do not use\nsecondary labels with line tabs or auto-width contained tabs.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Example of tabs with a secondary label](images/tab-usage-14.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n<Caption>Note: The secondary label is an example of a pattern. It is not currently implemented in the component.</Caption>\n\n## Related\n\n#### Content switcher versus tabs\n\n[Content switchers](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/content-switcher/usage/)\nallow users to compare and toggle between alternate views of similar or related\ncontent. Content that is grouped into tabs is part of the same bigger context\nbut the content does not overlap.\n\n#### Navigation versus tabs\n\nTabs should not be used for common navigation patterns. If your tab arrangements\nare becoming too complex with different levels of content, consider using\n[left](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/UI-shell-left-panel/usage/)\nor\n[right](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/UI-shell-right-panel/usage/)\nUI panels, possibly in conjunction with breadcrumbs, to help the user through\nthe content.\n\n#### Progress indicator versus tabs\n\n[Progress indicator](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/progress-indicator/usage/)\ncontent moves in a logical progression, showing next steps to guide the user\nthrough the completion of a task. Tabs organize content into groups that the\nuser can navigate through; they do not support progressive tasks.\n\n## References\n\nJakob Nielson,\n[Tabs, Used Right](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/tabs-used-right/) (Nielsen\nNorman Group, 2016)\n\n## Feedback\n\nHelp us improve this component by providing feedback, asking questions, and\nleaving any other comments on\n[GitHub](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-website/issues/new?assignees=&labels=feedback&template=feedback.md).\n","fileAbsolutePath":"/home/runner/work/carbon-website/carbon-website/src/pages/components/tabs/usage.mdx"}}},
