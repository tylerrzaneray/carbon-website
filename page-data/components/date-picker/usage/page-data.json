The kind of\ndate (exact, approximate, memorable) you are requesting from the user will\ndetermine which picker is best to use. Each picker's format can be customized\ndepending on location or need.\n\n### When to use\n\nUse date and time pickers when you are asking the user for a time or date, or\nfor scheduling tasks.\n\n### Variants\n\n| Variant             | Purpose                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |\n| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| _Simple date input_ | Use if the date can be remembered by the user easily, such as a date of birth, and they don’t need a calendar to anticipate the dates.

do with the control.\n2. **Date field**: A text input field where the user can manually type in the\n   date.\n3. **Icon**: `calendar` icon indicates the calendar menu is available.\n4. **Calendar**: The menu where a date may be selected.\n5. **Month and year controls**: Allows the user to navigate through past and\n   future time frames.\n6. **Previous and next month controls**: Allows the user to move forward or\n   backward one month at a time.\n7. **Day**: Days in the month.\n\n### Anatomy of a time picker\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Time picker anatomy](images/time-picker-anatomy.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n<Caption>Anatomy of a time picker</Caption>\n\n1. **Label**: Instructs the user what to do with the control.\n2. **Hour and minute field**: A text input field where the user types the hours\n   and minutes of the desired time.\n3. **AM/PM selector**: A select control that allows the user to choose time\n   period.\n4. **Timezone selector**: A select control that allows the user to set the\n   associated time zone.\n\n### Alignment\n\nBy default, the pickers have fixed widths. If you are placing the picker inline\nwith other inputs, such as in form, then the widths can be adjusted to match the\nother inputs. The picker can either increase or decrease in width as needed. If\nyou adjust the size, be aware that pickers have minimum widths and the date\ncontent should never horizontal scroll or overflow.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Alignment example](images/date-picker-alignment-01.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\nThe calendar itself will always remain a fixed width and is not adjustable. It\nshould always be aligned to the left edge of its assigned text field.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={12}>\n\n![Alignment example](images/date-picker-alignment-02.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n### Sizes\n\nDate picker comes in three sizes: small (32px), medium (40px), and large (48px).\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Size example](images/date-picker-sizes.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n## Content\n\n### Main elements\n\n#### Label\n\n- Both date and time pickers must be accompanied with labels.\n- The labels should be clear and descriptive.\n- Range inputs should be being properly labeled with a start and end label.\n\n#### Date format\n\n- The date format can be displayed differently depending on your location. For\n  example, some countries use month/day/year while other use day/month/year.\n- When using a simple date input include the date format in parentheses inline\n  with the label or as helper text below the label.\n- When using calendar picker the date format will be automated if the user\n  selects from the calendar menu.\n- Only including the date format as placeholder text inside the field is\n  problematic because it will disappear from view once the user begins typing.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Alignment example](images/date-format-placement.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n#### Time format\n\n- Both the 12-hour and 24-hour time systems are allowed.\n- If using the 12-hour format it must be accompanied by an AM/PM selection.\n- Use uppercase letters and no periods for the abbreviations AM and PM.\n- Specific times should specify a timezone.\n\n### Further guidance\n\nFor further content guidance, see\nCarbon’s [content guidelines](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/guidelines/content/overview/).\n\n## Universal behaviors\n\nThe behaviors listed in this section are universal across all of the variants.\nFor behaviors that are unique to each variant, see each of the component variant\nsections below.\n\n### States\n\n#### Validation\n\nInvalid fields should be clearly marked. In pickers with more than one field,\nthe invalid state should only be set on the individual factor that is triggering\nthe error so the user can clearly understand which to address.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Validation example](images/date-picker-validation.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n### Internationalization\n\nInternationalization, also referred to as globalization, refers to software\nadapting to different languages, regional peculiarities, and technical\nrequirements of a target locale without additional code changes. This means that\nif the location is known, then formatting of a date or time can automatically\nchange to the acceptable local format. You should always try to design for\ninternationalization.\n\n## Simple date input\n\nThe simple date input provides the user with only a text field in which they can\nmanually input a date. It allows dates to be entered without adding unnecessary\ninteractions that come with the calendar menu or a dropdown.\n\nThe simple date input can include _month/year_ or _month/day/year._ The\nformatting may be localized and rearranged in sequence of appearance.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Simple date input](images/single-date-input.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n### When to use\n\n#### Use for memorable dates\n\nSimple date inputs are typically used when the date is known by the user, such\nas a date of birth or credit card expiration.\n\n#### Use for approximate dates\n\nSimple date inputs are best for when asking the user for an approximate date\ninstead of an exact date, especially in regards to past dates. For example, when\nwas asking a user when a purchase was made they will most likely easily recall\nthe month and year (November 2019) versus the specific date (November 22, 2019).\n\n### States\n\nThe simple date input is a [text input](/components/text-input/usage) and has\nthe same interactive state and behaviors. See the\n[style tab](/components/date-picker/style) for more details.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Simple date input states](images/simple-date-input-states.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n## Calendar pickers\n\nCalendar pickers default to showing today's date when opened and only one month\nis shown at a time. Calendar pickers allow users to navigate through months and\nyears, however they work best when used for recent or near future dates. If a\nuser needs to input a far distant or future date consider having the calendar\ndefault open to a more convenient day.\n\nKeep in mind that some users may find calendar pickers difficult to use. There\nshould always be a simple way to enter dates in a text field when using calendar\npickers.\n\n#### Use for scheduling\n\nUse a calendar picker when the user needs to know a date's relation to other\ndays such as the day of the week it falls on or its proximity to today. They are\noptimal for scheduling tasks.\n\n### Variants\n\n#### Single date picker\n\nIn a single date picker a user has the option to either manually input a date in\nthe text field or select one specific date from the menu calendar. It requires a\nday, month, and year to be selected.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Single date calendar picker](images/single-date-picker.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n1. Today's date\n2. Hover\n3. Day in month\n4. Selected day\n5. Day in next/previous month\n\n#### Date range picker\n\nThe date range picker functions much like the single date picker but instead of\nchoosing just one date the user can choose a `start` and `end` date. For each\ndate in the range, users have the option to manually enter the date in a text\nfield or select the date in the calendar. Each point requires a day, month, and\nyear to be selected.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Date range calendar picker](images/range-date-picker.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n1. Day in month\n2. Today\n3. Selected start date\n4. Day in range\n5. End date hover and focus\n6. Day in next/previous month\n\n### Calendar behaviors\n\n#### Opening the calendar\n\nThe calendar can be opened in two ways:\n\n- Clicking the `calendar` icon on the far right of the field opens the calendar\n  menu.\n- When the text field receives focus the calendar menu also appears and remains\n  open until a date is selected or the focus is removed from the picker.\n\n#### Selecting a date\n\nA date can be selected by:\n\n- Manually entering a date in the text input field.\n- Clicking on a date in the calendar menu.\n- Navigating to a date by using the `Arrow` keys and then pressing `Enter`.\n\n#### Next and previous month\n\nA user can navigate between the months in a year by:\n\n- Clicking on `chevron` icons at the top left and right of the calendar.\n- Using the `Arrow` keys to move through the into the next or previous month.\n\n#### Selecting a year\n\nBy default the current date and year appears in the calendar. To navigate to\nanother year the user can do one of the following:\n\n- Manually typing the year in the date text field.\n- Clicking the up and down arrows that appear when you focus or hover on the\n  year input in the calendar.\n- Selecting then typing into the year input.\n\n#### Closing the calendar\n\nThe calendar can be closed in one of the following ways:\n\n- Selecting a single date or the end date in a range. This will automatically\n  close it.\n- Clicking anywhere outside of the calendar menu.\n- Removing focus from the picker.\n- Pressing `Esc`.\n\n#### Selecting a range\n\nThere are several ways in which a range can be selected:\n\n- Manually type the start and end dates in the text field.\n- Once the calendar is open the first date you click becomes the start date and\n  second date you click becomes the end date.\n- Navigating to the start date by using the `Arrow` keys and pressing `Enter`.\n  Then continue using the `Arrow` keys to navigate to a second date and press\n  `Enter` again.\n\n#### Min and max dates\n\nIn order to constrain the possible selectable dates in a calendar, a min and max\ndate may be set. Once set, only the dates that fall within the min/max range\nwill be selectable with the dates outside of the range being disabled.\n\nUse min and max dates to help prevent user error. If a user cannot select dates\nin the past when scheduling, then set a min date to today.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Min and max date example](images/calendar-picker-min-max.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n<Caption>The dates before today are out of range and disabled. </Caption>\n\n## Time pickers\n\nTime pickers provide the user with a text field in which they can input the hour\nand minutes. Additionally, they can be accompanied by an AM/PM and a time zone\ncontrol, both styled as selects.\n\nThe time field format should include the hour and minutes, for example 11:30. It\nmay be localized accommodate the 12-hour or 24-hour format.\n\n#### Use for scheduling\n\nUse the time picker when a specific time needs to be scheduled, such as planning\na meeting time.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={12}>\n\n![Time picker example](images/time-picker-example.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n## Modifiers\n\n### Light variant\n\nUse the `light` prop modifier when placing date pickers on alternate\nbackgrounds. The light prop will change the background color token of the inputs\nfrom `field-01` to `field-02`. This is frequently used in form modals or when on\na tile.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Light prop example](images/date-picker-light-prop.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n<Caption>\n  {' '}\n  Both inputs are displayed in the white theme but the one on the right is using\n  the light prop on the alternate UI background.{' '}\n</Caption>\n\n## Related\n\n#### Asking for relative times and dates\n\nAnother common use case not accounted for in the above pickers is setting a time\nor date relative to today or now, such as with a reminder. For example, setting\nan install to begin now, in one hour, or tonight. This variant of picker can\nmade by using the standard [select](/components/select/usage/) component.\n\n#### Using individual inputs\n\nAnother acceptable form of a time or date experience would be using individual\ninputs for each factor. Using an individual field for each factor of a date or\ntime can help reduce formatting errors. This is especially beneficial when\nlocalization cannot be used to reformat dates.\n\nInstead of having one input for an exact date (month/day/year), you could have\nthree separate inputs and a clear label for each.\n\n## Feedback\n\nHelp us improve this component by providing feedback, asking questions, and\nleaving any other comments on\n[GitHub](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-website/issues/new?assignees=&labels=feedback&template=feedback.md).\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"d62c3e6895c6e11961139cf9f5f9d8a2","owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx","counter":3914},"frontmatter":{"title":"Date picker","description":"Date and time pickers allow users to select a single or a range of dates and times.","tabs":["Usage","Style","Code","Accessibility"]},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: Date picker\ndescription:\n  Date and time pickers allow users to select a single or a range of dates and\n  times.\ntabs: ['Usage', 'Style', 'Code', 'Accessibility']\n---\n\n<PageDescription>\n\nDate and time pickers allow users to select a single or a range of dates and\ntimes.\n\n</PageDescription>\n\n<AnchorLinks>\n\n<AnchorLink>Overview</AnchorLink>\n<AnchorLink>Live demo</AnchorLink>\n<AnchorLink>Formatting</AnchorLink>\n<AnchorLink>Content</AnchorLink>\n<AnchorLink>Universal behaviors</AnchorLink>\n<AnchorLink>Simple date input</AnchorLink>\n<AnchorLink>Calendar pickers</AnchorLink>\n<AnchorLink>Time pickers</AnchorLink>\n<AnchorLink>Related</AnchorLink>\n<AnchorLink>Feedback</AnchorLink>\n\n</AnchorLinks>\n\n## Overview\n\nPickers are used to display past, present, or future dates or times.

anatomy](images/date-picker-anatomy.png)\n\n<Caption>\n  Anatomy of a simple date input and a single date calendar picker\n</Caption>\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n1. **Label**: Instructs the user what to do with the control.\n2. **Date field**: A text input field where the user can manually type in the\n   date.\n3. **Icon**: `calendar` icon indicates the calendar menu is available.\n4. **Calendar**: The menu where a date may be selected.\n5. **Month and year controls**: Allows the user to navigate through past and\n   future time frames.\n6. **Previous and next month controls**: Allows the user to move forward or\n   backward one month at a time.\n7. **Day**: Days in the month.\n\n### Anatomy of a time picker\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Time picker anatomy](images/time-picker-anatomy.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n<Caption>Anatomy of a time picker</Caption>\n\n1. **Label**: Instructs the user what to do with the control.\n2. **Hour and minute field**: A text input field where the user types the hours\n   and minutes of the desired time.\n3. **AM/PM selector**: A select control that allows the user to choose time\n   period.\n4. **Timezone selector**: A select control that allows the user to set the\n   associated time zone.\n\n### Alignment\n\nBy default, the pickers have fixed widths. If you are placing the picker inline\nwith other inputs, such as in form, then the widths can be adjusted to match the\nother inputs. The picker can either increase or decrease in width as needed. If\nyou adjust the size, be aware that pickers have minimum widths and the date\ncontent should never horizontal scroll or overflow.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Alignment example](images/date-picker-alignment-01.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\nThe calendar itself will always remain a fixed width and is not adjustable. It\nshould always be aligned to the left edge of its assigned text field.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={12}>\n\n![Alignment example](images/date-picker-alignment-02.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n### Sizes\n\nDate picker comes in three sizes: small (32px), medium (40px), and large (48px).\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Size example](images/date-picker-sizes.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n## Content\n\n### Main elements\n\n#### Label\n\n- Both date and time pickers must be accompanied with labels.\n- The labels should be clear and descriptive.\n- Range inputs should be being properly labeled with a start and end label.\n\n#### Date format\n\n- The date format can be displayed differently depending on your location. For\n  example, some countries use month/day/year while other use day/month/year.\n- When using a simple date input include the date format in parentheses inline\n  with the label or as helper text below the label.\n- When using calendar picker the date format will be automated if the user\n  selects from the calendar menu.\n- Only including the date format as placeholder text inside the field is\n  problematic because it will disappear from view once the user begins typing.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Alignment example](images/date-format-placement.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n#### Time format\n\n- Both the 12-hour and 24-hour time systems are allowed.\n- If using the 12-hour format it must be accompanied by an AM/PM selection.\n- Use uppercase letters and no periods for the abbreviations AM and PM.\n- Specific times should specify a timezone.\n\n### Further guidance\n\nFor further content guidance, see\nCarbon’s [content guidelines](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/guidelines/content/overview/).\n\n## Universal behaviors\n\nThe behaviors listed in this section are universal across all of the variants.\nFor behaviors that are unique to each variant, see each of the component variant\nsections below.\n\n### States\n\n#### Validation\n\nInvalid fields should be clearly marked. In pickers with more than one field,\nthe invalid state should only be set on the individual factor that is triggering\nthe error so the user can clearly understand which to address.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Validation example](images/date-picker-validation.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n### Internationalization\n\nInternationalization, also referred to as globalization, refers to software\nadapting to different languages, regional peculiarities, and technical\nrequirements of a target locale without additional code changes. This means that\nif the location is known, then formatting of a date or time can automatically\nchange to the acceptable local format. You should always try to design for\ninternationalization.\n\n## Simple date input\n\nThe simple date input provides the user with only a text field in which they can\nmanually input a date. It allows dates to be entered without adding unnecessary\ninteractions that come with the calendar menu or a dropdown.\n\nThe simple date input can include _month/year_ or _month/day/year._ The\nformatting may be localized and rearranged in sequence of appearance.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Simple date input](images/single-date-input.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n### When to use\n\n#### Use for memorable dates\n\nSimple date inputs are typically used when the date is known by the user, such\nas a date of birth or credit card expiration.\n\n#### Use for approximate dates\n\nSimple date inputs are best for when asking the user for an approximate date\ninstead of an exact date, especially in regards to past dates. For example, when\nwas asking a user when a purchase was made they will most likely easily recall\nthe month and year (November 2019) versus the specific date (November 22, 2019).\n\n### States\n\nThe simple date input is a [text input](/components/text-input/usage) and has\nthe same interactive state and behaviors. See the\n[style tab](/components/date-picker/style) for more details.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Simple date input states](images/simple-date-input-states.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n## Calendar pickers\n\nCalendar pickers default to showing today's date when opened and only one month\nis shown at a time. Calendar pickers allow users to navigate through months and\nyears, however they work best when used for recent or near future dates. If a\nuser needs to input a far distant or future date consider having the calendar\ndefault open to a more convenient day.\n\nKeep in mind that some users may find calendar pickers difficult to use. There\nshould always be a simple way to enter dates in a text field when using calendar\npickers.\n\n#### Use for scheduling\n\nUse a calendar picker when the user needs to know a date's relation to other\ndays such as the day of the week it falls on or its proximity to today. They are\noptimal for scheduling tasks.\n\n### Variants\n\n#### Single date picker\n\nIn a single date picker a user has the option to either manually input a date in\nthe text field or select one specific date from the menu calendar. It requires a\nday, month, and year to be selected.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Single date calendar picker](images/single-date-picker.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n1. Today's date\n2. Hover\n3. Day in month\n4. Selected day\n5. Day in next/previous month\n\n#### Date range picker\n\nThe date range picker functions much like the single date picker but instead of\nchoosing just one date the user can choose a `start` and `end` date. For each\ndate in the range, users have the option to manually enter the date in a text\nfield or select the date in the calendar. Each point requires a day, month, and\nyear to be selected.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Date range calendar picker](images/range-date-picker.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n1. Day in month\n2. Today\n3. Selected start date\n4. Day in range\n5. End date hover and focus\n6. Day in next/previous month\n\n### Calendar behaviors\n\n#### Opening the calendar\n\nThe calendar can be opened in two ways:\n\n- Clicking the `calendar` icon on the far right of the field opens the calendar\n  menu.\n- When the text field receives focus the calendar menu also appears and remains\n  open until a date is selected or the focus is removed from the picker.\n\n#### Selecting a date\n\nA date can be selected by:\n\n- Manually entering a date in the text input field.\n- Clicking on a date in the calendar menu.\n- Navigating to a date by using the `Arrow` keys and then pressing `Enter`.\n\n#### Next and previous month\n\nA user can navigate between the months in a year by:\n\n- Clicking on `chevron` icons at the top left and right of the calendar.\n- Using the `Arrow` keys to move through the into the next or previous month.\n\n#### Selecting a year\n\nBy default the current date and year appears in the calendar. To navigate to\nanother year the user can do one of the following:\n\n- Manually typing the year in the date text field.\n- Clicking the up and down arrows that appear when you focus or hover on the\n  year input in the calendar.\n- Selecting then typing into the year input.\n\n#### Closing the calendar\n\nThe calendar can be closed in one of the following ways:\n\n- Selecting a single date or the end date in a range. This will automatically\n  close it.\n- Clicking anywhere outside of the calendar menu.\n- Removing focus from the picker.\n- Pressing `Esc`.\n\n#### Selecting a range\n\nThere are several ways in which a range can be selected:\n\n- Manually type the start and end dates in the text field.\n- Once the calendar is open the first date you click becomes the start date and\n  second date you click becomes the end date.\n- Navigating to the start date by using the `Arrow` keys and pressing `Enter`.\n  Then continue using the `Arrow` keys to navigate to a second date and press\n  `Enter` again.\n\n#### Min and max dates\n\nIn order to constrain the possible selectable dates in a calendar, a min and max\ndate may be set. Once set, only the dates that fall within the min/max range\nwill be selectable with the dates outside of the range being disabled.\n\nUse min and max dates to help prevent user error. If a user cannot select dates\nin the past when scheduling, then set a min date to today.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Min and max date example](images/calendar-picker-min-max.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n<Caption>The dates before today are out of range and disabled. </Caption>\n\n## Time pickers\n\nTime pickers provide the user with a text field in which they can input the hour\nand minutes. Additionally, they can be accompanied by an AM/PM and a time zone\ncontrol, both styled as selects.\n\nThe time field format should include the hour and minutes, for example 11:30. It\nmay be localized accommodate the 12-hour or 24-hour format.\n\n#### Use for scheduling\n\nUse the time picker when a specific time needs to be scheduled, such as planning\na meeting time.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={12}>\n\n![Time picker example](images/time-picker-example.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n## Modifiers\n\n### Light variant\n\nUse the `light` prop modifier when placing date pickers on alternate\nbackgrounds. The light prop will change the background color token of the inputs\nfrom `field-01` to `field-02`. This is frequently used in form modals or when on\na tile.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Light prop example](images/date-picker-light-prop.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n<Caption>\n  {' '}\n  Both inputs are displayed in the white theme but the one on the right is using\n  the light prop on the alternate UI background.{' '}\n</Caption>\n\n## Related\n\n#### Asking for relative times and dates\n\nAnother common use case not accounted for in the above pickers is setting a time\nor date relative to today or now, such as with a reminder. For example, setting\nan install to begin now, in one hour, or tonight. This variant of picker can\nmade by using the standard [select](/components/select/usage/) component.\n\n#### Using individual inputs\n\nAnother acceptable form of a time or date experience would be using individual\ninputs for each factor. Using an individual field for each factor of a date or\ntime can help reduce formatting errors. This is especially beneficial when\nlocalization cannot be used to reformat dates.\n\nInstead of having one input for an exact date (month/day/year), you could have\nthree separate inputs and a clear label for each.\n\n## Feedback\n\nHelp us improve this component by providing feedback, asking questions, and\nleaving any other comments on\n[GitHub](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-website/issues/new?assignees=&labels=feedback&template=feedback.md).\n","fileAbsolutePath":"/home/runner/work/carbon-website/carbon-website/src/pages/components/date-picker/usage.mdx"}}},
