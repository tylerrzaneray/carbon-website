A file uploader is\ncommonly found in forms, but can also live as a standalone element. There are\ntwo variants of file uploaders—our default file uploader and a drag and drop\nfile uploader.\n\n### Variants\n\n| Variant                                                     | Way it works                                                                                |\n| ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| [File uploader](#file-uploader)                             | Upload one or more files by clicking an action button that prompts a file selection dialog. |\n| [Drag and drop file uploader](#drag-and-drop-file-uploader) | Drag and drop selected files directly into a drop zone area to upload.                      |\n\n### When to use\n\n- Uploading one or more files.\n- Uploading files by dragging and dropping.\n- Showing the process of uploading.\n\n### When not to use\n\n- Do not use upload in a modal when multiple files are uploaded, as uploaded\n  files stack vertically.\n\n## Live demo\n\n<ComponentDemo\n  components={[\n    {\n      id: 'file-uploader',\n      label: 'File uploader',\n    },\n    {\n      id: 'drag-and-drop',\n      label: 'Drag and drop',\n    },\n    {\n      id: 'upload-states',\n      label: 'Upload states',\n    },\n  ]}\n>\n  <ComponentVariant\n    id=\"file-uploader\"\n    knobs={{\n      FileUploader: ['multiple'],\n    }}\n    links={{\n      React:\n        'https://react.carbondesignsystem.com/?path=/story/components-fileuploader--file-uploader',\n      Angular:\n        'https://angular.carbondesignsystem.com/?path=/story/components-file-uploader--basic',\n      Vue: 'http://vue.carbondesignsystem.com/?path=/story/components-cvfileuploader--default',\n      'Web Components':\n        'https://web-components.carbondesignsystem.com/?path=/story/components-file-uploader--default',\n    }}\n  >{`\n      <div className=\"cds--file__container\">\n        <FileUploader\n          accept={[\n            '.jpg',\n            '.png'\n          ]}\n          buttonKind=\"primary\"\n          buttonLabel=\"Add files\"\n          filenameStatus=\"edit\"\n          iconDescription=\"Clear file\"\n          labelDescription=\"only .jpg files at 500mb or less\"\n          labelTitle=\"Upload\"\n        />\n      </div>\n    `}</ComponentVariant>\n  <ComponentVariant\n    id=\"drag-and-drop\"\n    knobs={{\n      FileUploaderDropContainer: ['multiple', 'disabled'],\n    }}\n    links={{\n      React:\n        'https://react.carbondesignsystem.com/?path=/story/components-fileuploader--drag-and-drop-upload-container-example-application',\n      Angular:\n        'https://angular.carbondesignsystem.com/?path=/story/components-file-uploader--drag-and-drop',\n      Vue: 'http://vue.carbondesignsystem.com/?path=/story/components-cvfileuploader--default',\n      'Web Components':\n        'https://web-components.carbondesignsystem.com/?path=/story/components-file-uploader--default',\n    }}\n  >{`\n      <div className=\"cds--file__container\">\n        <strong className='cds--file--label'>Account photo</strong>\n        <p className='cds--label-description'>\n          Only .jpg and .png files. 500kb max file size\n        </p>\n        <FileUploaderDropContainer\n          accept={[\n            'image/jpeg',\n            'image/png'\n          ]}\n          labelText=\"Drag and drop files here or click to upload\"\n          tabIndex={0}\n        />\n      </div>\n    `}</ComponentVariant>\n  <ComponentVariant\n    id=\"upload-states\"\n    knobs={{\n      FileUploaderItem: ['status', 'invalid'],\n    }}\n    links={{\n      React:\n        'https://react.carbondesignsystem.com/?path=/story/components-fileuploader--file-uploader-item',\n      Angular:\n        'https://angular.carbondesignsystem.com/?path=/story/components-file-uploader--basic',\n      Vue: 'http://vue.carbondesignsystem.com/?path=/story/components-cvfileuploader--default',\n      'Web Components':\n        'https://web-components.carbondesignsystem.com/?path=/story/components-file-uploader--default',\n    }}\n  >{`\n      <div className=\"cds--file__container\">\n        <FileUploaderItem name='color.jpg' errorSubject='File size exceeds limits' errorBody='500 kb max file size.

Once you have selected one or more\nfiles from the dialog, the selected files will populate below the file uploader\non the page. Your file may temporarily display a loading state before uploading\nhas been successfully completed.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={12}>\n\n![File uploader in context example](images/file-uploader-usage-9.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n## Drag and drop file uploader\n\nDrag and drop file uploaders are used to directly upload files by dragging and\ndropping them into a drop zone area. Alternatively, you can also traditionally\nopen files through a file selection dialog by clicking the text link description\ninside the drop zone.\n\nThe drop zone component lets users upload files by dragging and dropping the\nfiles into an area on a page, or activating a button.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={12}>\n\n![File uploader in context example](images/file-uploader-usage-10a.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\nWhen dragging files into the drop zone area, the drop zone border changes in\ncolor and thickness to indicate the area has been activated and is ready for\nfiles. Additionally once the cursor hits the drop zone area it changes with a\npreview of the file you are about to upload. The style of cursor change is\nrendered by the browser you use.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Drag and drop file uploader in context example](images/file-uploader-usage-10b.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n## References\n\nPage Laubheimer,\n[Drag–and–Drop: How to Design for Ease of Use](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/drag-drop/),\n(Nielsen Norman Group, 2020)\n\n## Feedback\n\nHelp us improve this component by providing feedback, asking questions, and\nleaving any other comments on\n[GitHub](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-website/issues/new?assignees=&labels=feedback&template=feedback.md).\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"9a296191f85389bc076898c5169a26b3","owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx","counter":3910},"frontmatter":{"title":"File uploader","description":"File uploaders allow users to select one or more files to upload to a specific location.","tabs":["Usage","Style","Code","Accessibility"]},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: File uploader\ndescription:\n  File uploaders allow users to select one or more files to upload to a specific\n  location.\ntabs: ['Usage', 'Style', 'Code', 'Accessibility']\n---\n\n<PageDescription>\n\nFile uploaders allow users to select one or more files to upload to a specific\nlocation.\n\n</PageDescription>\n\n<AnchorLinks>\n\n<AnchorLink>Overview</AnchorLink>\n<AnchorLink>Live demo</AnchorLink>\n<AnchorLink>Formatting</AnchorLink>\n<AnchorLink>Content</AnchorLink>\n<AnchorLink>Universal behaviors</AnchorLink>\n<AnchorLink>File uploader</AnchorLink>\n<AnchorLink>Drag and drop file uploader</AnchorLink>\n<AnchorLink>References</AnchorLink>\n<AnchorLink>Feedback</AnchorLink>\n\n</AnchorLinks>\n\n## Overview\n\nFile uploaders allow users to upload content of their own.

Once you have selected one or more\nfiles from the dialog, the selected files will populate below the file uploader\non the page. Your file may temporarily display a loading state before uploading\nhas been successfully completed.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={12}>\n\n![File uploader in context example](images/file-uploader-usage-9.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n## Drag and drop file uploader\n\nDrag and drop file uploaders are used to directly upload files by dragging and\ndropping them into a drop zone area. Alternatively, you can also traditionally\nopen files through a file selection dialog by clicking the text link description\ninside the drop zone.\n\nThe drop zone component lets users upload files by dragging and dropping the\nfiles into an area on a page, or activating a button.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={12}>\n\n![File uploader in context example](images/file-uploader-usage-10a.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\nWhen dragging files into the drop zone area, the drop zone border changes in\ncolor and thickness to indicate the area has been activated and is ready for\nfiles. Additionally once the cursor hits the drop zone area it changes with a\npreview of the file you are about to upload. The style of cursor change is\nrendered by the browser you use.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Drag and drop file uploader in context example](images/file-uploader-usage-10b.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n## References\n\nPage Laubheimer,\n[Drag–and–Drop: How to Design for Ease of Use](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/drag-drop/),\n(Nielsen Norman Group, 2020)\n\n## Feedback\n\nHelp us improve this component by providing feedback, asking questions, and\nleaving any other comments on\n[GitHub](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-website/issues/new?assignees=&labels=feedback&template=feedback.md).\n","fileAbsolutePath":"/home/runner/work/carbon-website/carbon-website/src/pages/components/file-uploader/usage.mdx"}}},
