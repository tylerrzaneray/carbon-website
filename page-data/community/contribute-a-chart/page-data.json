In the\n   [index folder](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-website/tree/main/src/data/chart-index)\n   of the carbon-website GitHub repo, open your team folder. Create a folder if\n   your team doesn’t have one yet.\n2. Click `Add file` (top right), then `Create new file`.\n3. Name your file `chart-name.yml`, where _chart-name_ is the name of your\n   chart.\n4. Copy and paste the following template into the `Edit new file` section of the\n   page and fill out the correct information for your component.\n\n   ```\n   name: chart name\n   website_url: >-\n     url of documentation / guidance page (if any)\n   code_url: >-\n     url of component code on GitHub (if any)\n   maintainer: name of maintainer team\n   description: >-\n     short description of purpose and usage of chart\n   chart_type: choose one of Comparisons | Trends | Part-to-whole | Correlations | Connections | Geospatial | Other\n   complexity: choose one of Basic | Advanced\n   platform: Web\n   aliases:\n     - fuzzy term for component (e.g. an alias for a \"alluvial\" chart might be \"flow\")\n   date_added: YYY-MM-DDT00:00:00.000Z\n   ```\n\n5. Once done, click the green `Commit new file` button at the bottom.\n\nAfter submitting the PR for the data, you should upload a thumbnail image.\n\n1. Go back to your team folder in the\n   [index](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-website/tree/main/src/data/chart-index).\n2. Inside your team folder, open the `images` folder.\n3. In the top right, click `Add file` then `Upload files` to upload your image\n   to that page then submit the PR. Note: name your image file with the same\n   name as the chart (e.g. `chart-name.png` to match `component-name.yml`). Your\n   image should be 320px x 240px.\n\nAnd you’re done! The Carbon team will review and merge the PR.\n\nIf you’re unsure about how to make a PR through GitHub, create an issue in the\nrepo instead and we’ll help you out. Be sure to include all the necessary\ncomponent information and images.\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"f3a8a4d284d0eb32e2d6406c448a4d19","owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx","counter":3841},"frontmatter":{"title":"Contribute a chart","description":"Anyone can add assets to the community chart index.
