Creating is distinct from adding, but\nthe two are often confused. To add a resource is to include a resource that\nalready exists. Editing a resource is also different from creating a new one.\nThis pattern focuses on how to place the user in a flow when there's a need for\ncreating a new resource.\n\nDo not use this pattern for [adding or editing a resource](#Related-use-cases).\n\n| Type             | Usage                                                                                | Context                                          |\n| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |\n| Inline           | Use with quick, simple creations like that of an item.                               | On-page content can be seen and interacted with. |\n| Modal            | Use with simple or transitional creations with no more than a couple of form fields. | On-page content is obscured.                     |\n| Side-panel       | Use with medium complexity creations if the user needs page context.                 | On-page content can be seen and interacted with. |\n| Narrow tearsheet | Use with medium complexity creations.                                                | On-page content is obscured.                     |\n| Wide tearsheet   | Use with complex or interactive creations.                                           | On-page content is obscured.                     |\n| Full page        | Use with creations that must be completed in order for a service to be usable.       | N/A                                              |\n\n## Inline creation\n\n#### When to use\n\nWith quick, simple creations like that of an item, it is usually preferred to\nkeep the flow inline. This is especially true when the user could benefit from\nseeing context in the page while creating. The inline create pattern is under\nconstruction, as it needs to account for many different use cases. Below is an\nexample of an inline creation.\n\n#### When not to use\n\nAnother factor to consider with quick, simple creations is whether or not the\nflow is transitional. Use a Modal if the user is being taken to a different page\nthan the one where they initiated the create. For example, if the newly created\nasset is being opened or if the user is taken to a confirmation screen.\n\nFor complex creation flows, such as that of a large system object, use the\nNarrow or Wide tearsheet variations for single or multistep options,\nrespectively.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n<img\n  src=\"/images/InlineCreateExample.gif\"\n  alt=\"Animated inline create example\"\n  title=\"Animated inline create example\"\n  style={{ padding: '3rem', backgroundColor: '#e0e0e0' }}\n/>\n\n<Caption>Example of an inline create</Caption> \n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n## Modal\n\n#### When to use\n\n- Use a modal for simple creations with one or two form fields to be filled out.\n- Use for transitions when the user will be taken to a different page after\n  creation.\n\n#### When not to use a modal\n\n- Don't use a modal in place of an inline create.\n- Don't use a modal if there are more than four form fields or if there is\n  scrolling inside the modal.\n\n### Anatomy of a modal\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Anatomy of a create modal](images/ModalAnatomy.jpg)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n1. **Modal size & overlay: **\n   [Small Modal](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/modal/style#small).\n   Screen overlay that obscures the on-page content.\n2. **Create title:** Title line for the create flow with an optional subtitle.\n3. **Body:** Contains the information and/or controls needed to populate the\n   task.

Toggling to \"Show all available\noptions\" will replace the progress indicator with the In-page navigation anchor\nlinks.\n\n### Leaving the Create flow\n\nFull page create flows can be exited not only by clicking on \"Cancel\", but also\nby navigating away by clicking on breadcrumbs or other page navigation. When the\nuser tries to exit the Create flow by any means other than explicitly clicking\non the word \"Cancel\", we must show a confirmation modal.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Confirm cancel Create modal on Full page](images/FullPageCancelCreateModal.jpg)\n\n<Caption>With Full page flows, show a confirmation modal when the user navigates away.</Caption>\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n## Designing with creation flows\n\n### Behaviors\n\n#### Triggers\n\nA create flow is usually started when the user clicks on a \"New `asset type`\"\nbutton. The button text should include the type of asset and a plus icon. For\nexample, \"New project\" or \"New user\". In many cases the button will be primary.\nHowever, there should be only one primary button in any page section. When there\nis already a primary button, a tertiary or ghost button should be used. Today,\nguidance around button types does not specify when to use tertiary versus ghost\nbuttons. This guideline will be updated as we get more clarity.\n\nAfter clicking on the new button, the user then fills out a form in one of the\nabove formats with one step or multiple steps. With multiple steps, the \"Back\"\nbutton is disabled in the first step. In the last step, the text of the primary\nbutton changes from \"Next\" to \"Create\". The \"Next\" and \"Create\" buttons should\nbe disabled until the user has entered all required fields.\n\n#### Dismissing flows\n\nThe Modal, Side panel, Narrow tearsheet and Wide tearsheet components in a\ncreate flow will not have a close icon in the top right. This is to enforce the\nuser's decision to exit the create flow by clicking on the word \"Cancel\".\n\n#### Flow completion & loading\n\nWhen the user clicks \"Create\" there should be an indication of loading or\nsubmitting. See Carbon's\n[Loading](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/patterns/loading-pattern#loading-indicators)\npattern. Also, see specific guidance for\n[loading in the Modal component](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/modal/usage#loading).\nOnce the loading is complete, the user should see a success or error\nnotification. For success, one option is to open the newly created asset or the\nasset's details page. When the user stays on the same page, show a success\nbanner notification. For errors, you must show an\n[error notification](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/notification/usage/).\n\n## Related use cases\n\n### Add\n\n- While the Create and Add patterns are similar, and ideas can certainly be\n  drawn from this pattern, it does not cover Add use cases.\n- The Add pattern should be looked at and worked on separately.\n\n### Edit\n\n- Similarly, while there are similar concepts in both Create and Edit, this\n  pattern does not cover Edit use cases.\n- The Edit pattern should be looked at and worked on separately.\n\n## Accessibility\n\nFollows accessibility guidelines for\n[Modal](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/modal/accessibility), Side\npanel, Narrow tearsheet, Wide tearsheet,\n[Forms](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/patterns/forms-pattern#accessibility),\nand\n[Progress indicator](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/progress-indicator/accessibility).\n\n## Related\n\n- [Modal](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/modal/usage/)\n- [Tearsheet](https://pages.github.ibm.com/cdai-design/pal/components/tearsheet/usage/)\n- [Form](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/patterns/forms-pattern/)\n- [Toggle](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/toggle/usage)\n- [Page header](https://pages.github.ibm.com/cdai-design/pal/components/page-header/usage)\n- [Progress indicator](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/progress-indicator/usage)\n\n## Feedback \n\nHelp us improve this pattern by providing feedback, asking questions, and\nleaving any other comments on\n[GitHub](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-website/issues/new?assignees=&labels=feedback&template=feedback.md).\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"bc23b4d5ed9d81979d2b3be43c95d456","owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx","counter":4111},"frontmatter":{"title":"Create flows","description":"To create is to generate a new resource.

Toggling to \"Show all available\noptions\" will replace the progress indicator with the In-page navigation anchor\nlinks.\n\n### Leaving the Create flow\n\nFull page create flows can be exited not only by clicking on \"Cancel\", but also\nby navigating away by clicking on breadcrumbs or other page navigation. When the\nuser tries to exit the Create flow by any means other than explicitly clicking\non the word \"Cancel\", we must show a confirmation modal.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Confirm cancel Create modal on Full page](images/FullPageCancelCreateModal.jpg)\n\n<Caption>With Full page flows, show a confirmation modal when the user navigates away.</Caption>\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n## Designing with creation flows\n\n### Behaviors\n\n#### Triggers\n\nA create flow is usually started when the user clicks on a \"New `asset type`\"\nbutton. The button text should include the type of asset and a plus icon. For\nexample, \"New project\" or \"New user\". In many cases the button will be primary.\nHowever, there should be only one primary button in any page section. When there\nis already a primary button, a tertiary or ghost button should be used. Today,\nguidance around button types does not specify when to use tertiary versus ghost\nbuttons. This guideline will be updated as we get more clarity.\n\nAfter clicking on the new button, the user then fills out a form in one of the\nabove formats with one step or multiple steps. With multiple steps, the \"Back\"\nbutton is disabled in the first step. In the last step, the text of the primary\nbutton changes from \"Next\" to \"Create\". The \"Next\" and \"Create\" buttons should\nbe disabled until the user has entered all required fields.\n\n#### Dismissing flows\n\nThe Modal, Side panel, Narrow tearsheet and Wide tearsheet components in a\ncreate flow will not have a close icon in the top right. This is to enforce the\nuser's decision to exit the create flow by clicking on the word \"Cancel\".\n\n#### Flow completion & loading\n\nWhen the user clicks \"Create\" there should be an indication of loading or\nsubmitting. See Carbon's\n[Loading](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/patterns/loading-pattern#loading-indicators)\npattern. Also, see specific guidance for\n[loading in the Modal component](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/modal/usage#loading).\nOnce the loading is complete, the user should see a success or error\nnotification. For success, one option is to open the newly created asset or the\nasset's details page. When the user stays on the same page, show a success\nbanner notification. For errors, you must show an\n[error notification](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/notification/usage/).\n\n## Related use cases\n\n### Add\n\n- While the Create and Add patterns are similar, and ideas can certainly be\n  drawn from this pattern, it does not cover Add use cases.\n- The Add pattern should be looked at and worked on separately.\n\n### Edit\n\n- Similarly, while there are similar concepts in both Create and Edit, this\n  pattern does not cover Edit use cases.\n- The Edit pattern should be looked at and worked on separately.\n\n## Accessibility\n\nFollows accessibility guidelines for\n[Modal](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/modal/accessibility), Side\npanel, Narrow tearsheet, Wide tearsheet,\n[Forms](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/patterns/forms-pattern#accessibility),\nand\n[Progress indicator](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/progress-indicator/accessibility).\n\n## Related\n\n- [Modal](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/modal/usage/)\n- [Tearsheet](https://pages.github.ibm.com/cdai-design/pal/components/tearsheet/usage/)\n- [Form](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/patterns/forms-pattern/)\n- [Toggle](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/toggle/usage)\n- [Page header](https://pages.github.ibm.com/cdai-design/pal/components/page-header/usage)\n- [Progress indicator](https://www.carbondesignsystem.com/components/progress-indicator/usage)\n\n## Feedback \n\nHelp us improve this pattern by providing feedback, asking questions, and\nleaving any other comments on\n[GitHub](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-website/issues/new?assignees=&labels=feedback&template=feedback.md).\n","fileAbsolutePath":"/home/runner/work/carbon-website/carbon-website/src/pages/community/patterns/create-flows/index.mdx"}}},
