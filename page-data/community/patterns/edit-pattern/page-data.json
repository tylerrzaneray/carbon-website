A modal can also be used where a small subset of fields are\neditable. If enough fields are editable to require scrolling, use a side-panel\nor full-page edit dialog instead.\n\n<Row>\n<Column colLg={8}>\n\n![Example of a low consequence edit action in a modal](images/03.png)\n\n<Caption>Example of a low consequence edit action in a modal</Caption>\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n### Side-panel\n\nIf an object was created in a side panel, its editable fields can be made\navailable in a side panel.
