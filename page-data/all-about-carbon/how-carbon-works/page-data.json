Although that means we build for the\ncompany's business needs, it also means we have a brilliant team of engineers\nand designers working full time to make Carbon better. As one of the world's\nlargest companies, IBM has thousands of people across the globe using and\ncontributing to Carbon.\n\nWe use what we build, and we've made it open source for anyone to use and\ncontribute back to.\n\n### Who is the Code of conduct for?\n\nThe Carbon Design System is built for everybody and if you use or contribute to\nCarbon, you are part of this community and we expect you to adhere to our\ncommunity standards.\n\n### Feedback and critique\n\nBuilding great products isn't easy, and there's usually more than one right\nanswer. If you're taking part in any discussion, whether on Slack, Twitter,\nGitter, GitHub, or even in person, please respect one another. Keep the mission\nin mind, and help us make Carbon better.\n\n### Be understanding\n\nDiffering needs and differing perspectives make Carbon comprehensive. Be\nwelcoming, be understanding, and be kind. If one user expresses frustrations or\ncomplications, there are likely dozens of others who feel the same way.\nEncourage community members to speak up.\n\n## Adoption\n\n**We conduct training classes and offer certifications.** These cover\nintroductions to Carbon and participating in this community. Each program is\npiloted internally and available upon release externally. We teach at\nconferences, bootcamp labs, and wherever else we're needed.\n\n**We engage the community.** We strive to be one of the world’s best design\nsystems and we’re always\n[open to feedback](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-website/issues/new?assignees=&labels=feedback&template=feedback.md&title=).\nWe communicate with you about Carbon's state and roadmap through GitHub support,\nblog posts, and Twitter.\n\n**Contributed components and patterns include a list of maintainers.** The\nCarbon team triages and supports maintenance requests that do not have a\nmaintainer.\n\n**We provide support for users of the design system.** The Carbon team engages\nwith users primarily through GitHub. A member of the Carbon team responds to all\nissues and pull requests.\n\n## Assets\n\n**We maintain a set of Sketch libraries containing Carbon components and\npatterns.** There is a funnel of contribution for rigorous Sketch symbols before\nthey are made available in Sketch libraries.\n\n**Carbon supports multiple code implementations.** These reflect the\nproduction-level design libraries. The frameworks are listed below with their\nprimary maintainers:\n\n- [React](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon): Carbon Core team\n- [CSS/Vanilla](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon): Carbon Core\n  team\n- [Angular](https://angular.carbondesignsystem.com/): Community maintained\n- [Vue](https://github.com/carbon-design-system/carbon-components-vue):\n  Community maintained\n- [Svelte](https://github.com/ibm/carbon-components-svelte): Community\n  maintained\n\n**Design patterns are harvested from products built with Carbon.** These become\npart of the design system. Teams can use these well-defined patterns in their\nwork and contribute patterns back to the system.\n\n## Contact us\n\nHave questions?
