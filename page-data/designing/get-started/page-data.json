If you're just starting out designing with Carbon, you're in\nthe right place. Here's a checklist of everything you need to get up and\nrunning.\n\n</PageDescription>\n\n<AnchorLinks>\n\n<AnchorLink>Install design kits</AnchorLink>\n<AnchorLink>Learn about foundational guidance</AnchorLink>\n<AnchorLink>Review our usage guidance</AnchorLink>\n<AnchorLink>Connect with us</AnchorLink>\n\n</AnchorLinks>\n\n## Install design kits\n\nOur primary design kit is [Sketch](/designing/kits/sketch) and we also have\n[Adobe XD](/designing/kits/adobe-xd) and [Axure](/designing/kits/axure) kits\navailable. Head on over to the Design kits section and follow the install\ninstructions to get set up.\n\nThese kits come with Carbon components so you don't have to build them. By using\nthe kits you automatically get any updates made by the Carbon team so you don't\nneed to go back and change any designs to match the latest release. And when\nhanding off to your developers there won't be confusion about the component and\nits behaviors.\n\nIn [Other resources](/designing/design-resources), you'll find links to icon\nlibraries, color palettes, grid and shell templates, the IBM Plex font, and the\nGithub repos.\n\n## Learn about foundational guidance\n\nCarbon expresses the IBM Design Language in product and delivers it through\ntools for designers and developers including guidance, tooling, components, and\nsupport. Learn what drives IBM’s design philosophy and principles so that you\ncan make informed decisions in your product work.\n\nThe IBM brand systems have been developed for various IBM businesses, audiences,\ncategories, and offerings. Read them to understand the rationale behind every\nvisual and verbal detail to ensure your work is built on these important\nfoundations. _This content is accessible to IBMers only._\n\n<Row className=\"resource-card-group\">\n<Column colLg={4} colMd={4} noGutterSm>\n  <ResourceCard\n    subTitle=\"IBM Design Language\"\n    href=\"https://www.ibm.com/design/language/\"\n    >\n\n![Bee icon](/images/bee.svg)\n\n  </ResourceCard>\n\n</Column>\n<Column colLg={4} colMd={4} noGutterSm>\n  <ResourceCard\n    subTitle=\"IBM Brand Systems\"\n    href=\"https://www.ibm.com/brand/systems\"\n    >\n\n![Bee icon](images/bee.svg)\n\n  </ResourceCard>\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n## Review our usage guidance\n\nOur usage guidance is detailed and thorough, and you'll learn a lot about the\nsystem by reading through the components and patterns documentation.\n\n- [Components](/components/overview): Carbon provides in-depth design usage and\n  style guidance for all components. It's important to be familiar with this\n  additional UX and visual guidance when you are designing with our components.\n\n- [Patterns](/patterns/overview): We also offer a range of key patterns—best\n  practice solutions for how a user achieves a goal. These design patterns have\n  been harvested from products built with Carbon, and have been reviewed and\n  approved for use by the Carbon governance team.\n\n## Connect with us\n\n### Join us and the Carbon community\n\n_For IBMers only:_ If you have a question about any aspect of the kits or tools,\nyou can reach out to us on Slack and use that as a way to connect with your\nfellow designers.
