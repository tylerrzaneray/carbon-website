When the axis contains a break, use a\nsinusoidal line to replace the straight axis line.\n\nOn the X axis, the break can be fluid with graph area size, with a minimum width\nof 16px. On the Y axis, we recommend using a fixed distance of 16px for the\nbreak.\n\nIf data is available during an axis break, re-style line segments to use 0.5px\nstroke and hide circles representing data points.\n\n<Row>\n<Column  colLg={8} colMd={4} colSm={4}>\n\n![Gap in data bar chart](images/axislabel-break-1.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\nIf data isn’t available between axis breakpoints, leave the area empty.\n\n<Row>\n<Column  colLg={8} colMd={4} colSm={4}>\n\n![Gap in data denoted by texture](images/axislabel-break-2.png)\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n\n## Time series\n\n#### Consistent increments\n\nNever change axis ticks increments to accommodate data availability.

When\npossible, use localized date and time format, or user preference. Otherwise, the\nchart defaults to the format presented below.\n\n#### Landmark labels\n\nWhenever data crosses into a new time cycle, such as a new day, month, or year,\nsemibold the label to make it a “landmark” label to provide additional context\nfor the labels following it.\n\n<Row>\n<Column  colLg={12} colMd={4} colSm={4}>\n\n![Gap in data denoted by texture](images/axislabel-timeseries.png)\n\n<Caption>Example of a time series plotted at 15 seconds intervals</Caption>\n\n</Column>\n</Row>\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"57100fc7c32d75a2cb90c259a57a81ea","owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx","counter":4064},"frontmatter":{"title":"Axes and labels","description":"Axes and labels provide critical context for the information within a chart."},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: Axes and labels\ndescription:\n  Axes and labels provide critical context for the information within a chart.\n---\n\n<PageDescription>\n\nAxes and labels provide critical context for the information within a chart.
