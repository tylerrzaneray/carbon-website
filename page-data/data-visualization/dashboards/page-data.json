A good presentation\ndashboard provides a big-picture view of the data while serving as a guide for\nthe audience to decide what areas they would like to focus on and explore.\n\nExamples include a car dashboard, a stock market ticker board, or a route map\nwith the locations of nearby gas stations layered on top.\n\n### Best practices\n\n#### Establish a strong hierarchy\n\nPrioritize data by importance, then create a clear visual hierarchy. The most\nimportant data should have the highest contrast and occupy the largest area.\n\nMost people in the west read left to right, then top to bottom. This is known as\nthe\n[F-shaped pattern](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/f-shaped-pattern-reading-web-content/).\nPlace the most important at the top of the page and follow the F-pattern for the\nremaining elements, finishing with the least important information.\n\n#### Limit the number of metrics\n\nNon-essential information should be provided as needed. Design a dashboard to\nreduce a page's complexity by stripping away anything that could distract a user\nfrom interpreting the information.\n\n#### Use consistent color assignments\n\nAlways use consistent colors for each data set within a dashboard.\n\n#### Use white space to enhance clarity\n\nWhite space either sets elements apart or brings them together to distinguish a\npoint's priority. Space acts as a visual separator and guides a user's eye\nthrough a page. It provides relief and breathing room. According to\n[research](http://www.humanfactors.com/newsletters/yeah_but_can_you_give_me_a_reference.asp)\nconducted by Human Factors International, white space increases comprehension by\nalmost 20 percent.\n\n## Exploration dashboard\n\nExploration dashboards allow users to interact with the data to discover\ninsights and identify patterns. Examples of actions a user may perform on data\ninclude search, sort and filter data, roll up, and drill down. Exploration\ndashboards are intended for people who seek to look beyond a primary view and\nhave to be very interactive.\n\nExamples include financial reports with roll up and drill down capabilities or\ninteractive maps that include zooming in and out. Others include business\npreviews with a search bar and additional data available on demand like opening\nhours and reviews.\n\n### Best practices\n\n#### Consistency is key\n\nAll charts should use the same layout and spacing, and have legends in the same\nposition relative to the charting area. Do not switch measurement systems, like\nimperial to metric.\n\n#### Linked charts\n\nMirror chart modifications like filter and zoom. When a user manipulates one\nchart, other charts showing related data sets should automatically update to\nprovide multi-dimensional views of the user’s action.\n\n#### Annotation\n\nUse annotations to highlight trends, averages, peaks, and valleys to provide\nadditional information. Annotations should help users interpret fluctuations in\nthe data. Avoid annotations that obstruct the view of data.\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"309e8a440752efbd80055bc42fe87a25","owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx","counter":4066},"frontmatter":{"title":"Dashboards","description":"Context is everything.
